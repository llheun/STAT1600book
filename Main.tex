\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Why Data?}

\subsubsection{Information vs. Data}

First, data is not information.  Researchers extract information from data.  The study of statistics will give us the tools (methods) to judge data validity and to interpret the information extracted from data.

\subsubsection{Designing studies}

Most scientific journals, after 1966, started to report statistical results.  For example, before 1966, FDA (Food and Drug Agency) approved many drugs with written statements from a physician saying that the drug was safe, after 1966 the FDA required statistical studies to show that the proposed drug did not harm.  Later, FDA expected that the drug would be therapeutic.

\subsubsection{Conducting research}

Unless a sample is biased (we will get to that later), it will reveal the truth about the population.  For example, let's suppose that a drug development team after working on a compound for several months decided to try the experimental drug themselves to test its effects before the animal safety studies were complete.  (By the way, this behavior is unethical.)  The team concluded that it appeared to be safe; however, a mouse study later showed that mice in the high dose group started to cannibalize themselves.   

\subsubsection{Developing critical thinking skills}

Critical thinking starts with asking these type of questions: How can I confirm the validity of these data? Is the source of these data credible?  What can I infer from these data?  And so forth.

\section{Knowledge and Data}

There is a difference between what we know, and what we think that we know.  Are vaccines safe?  Will the new tax rules bring more or less revenue?  Do mandatory seat belt laws save lives?   Will legalizing drugs lead to more addiction?  Do alternative therapies work as effectively as traditional treatments?  Does exercise help prevent illness and are people who generally exercise healthier? Do taller people make more money than shorter people?  \citep{naranjo2018}

We can settle most of these issues by looking at data.  What do the data tell us?  Even then, some problems can only be partially answered by at best incomplete data.  In this course, we will lay the groundwork for writing a protocol and  will discuss some fundamentals of sound scientific studies and data analysis.  In the process, we hope to become better consumers of information and better judges of what is real or not, and what remains to be proven.

\subsection{Building Knowledge Step-by-step}

Scientific studies often go through the following steps.  It might help to read the example in the next section, then read this again.

\subsubsection{1. Conceptualize the problem} \index{Concept}

Suppose that you wish to study the problem of interest.  The wording is usually broad. The idea at first may be too complex to understand so we look for ways to explain and describe it.

For example, perhaps we are interested in the effectiveness the iClicker within education.  We will want to clarify and define education.  Are we interested in investigating particular schools or grade levels?  Perhaps we want to look at a specific component of education, like science or look at different methods of instruction.   Clarifying specific concepts which we want to investigate and putting this into words helps bring focus to our study.

\subsubsection{2. Operationalize the problem}

As a researcher for your study you also need to come up with ways to narrow in on your problem of interest.  What specifically do you want to measure?  Here we are formulating the specific question we want to answer.  We are also beginning to define our variables.  We will need to know what we can measure to help answer our problem of interest.

Perhaps we are interested in looking at how well students are doing with several different methods of teaching science.  We may look at measures of assessment like how well they did on an exam or overall in a class given the different teaching methodologies.

\subsubsection{3. Design the study}

We need to address all the components of how our study will be performed.  We will likely need to identify the population of interest and to obtain a good representative sample of that population.  We will need to figure out how we will select the sample and how many groups we may be comparing.

In our study of science education will we sample from several schools or several districts?  If we take a sample of students from several schools, but from only one state, for example, our population would be students within that state.  If we wanted to define our population as education within the continental U.S., we might need to pull randomly from schools across the U.S.

\subsubsection{4. Collect the data}

In the data collection stage, we must decide what instrument we are using (questionnaire, interview, observation).  Once we have designed our study, we should be able to identify the primary variables of interest.  As we collect the data, we are gathering information to help us answer the question we have proposed.

In our example of science education, we collect scores on a particular assessment (exam) to see how well students are comprehending the material.

\subsubsection{5. Analyze the data}

Using the proper statistical methods and procedures for the data is an important step in the data analysis stage.  Also, checking the assumptions behind these statistical methods is critical.  Are we comparing means?  Proportions?  Are the differences in means/proportions statistically significant?  How do we know if there is a significant difference (if the differences we find are not likely due  to chance)?

In our exploration of teaching science perhaps we are comparing two different methodologies of teaching.  We may then compare the overall means of the two groups.

\subsubsection{6. Conclusions}

Do our results generalize to a larger population?  Check back to see how we defined the population so that we can generalize the results.  Are we concluding cause-and-effect relationship, did we do an experiment, or did we observe associations?  In our conclusions, we will want to identify limits to our study and suggest further research in our area.

As we summarize our study of science teaching, we could only afford to do a smaller study within a particular district.  We could then relate the results of our study, based on our sample of schools, to the population of the entire school district.  We may not be able to make conclusions to the whole state or the U.S. since our sample was not representative of the whole state or the U.S.  Depending on how the study was defined we may have only made observations of the teachers.  If we were investigating two distinct types of instruction, then this falls more within the realm of an experiment.  We, of course, would still need to identify and try to control for confounding variables, which might be difficult.

\subsubsection{7. Disseminate results}

How are we sharing our results?  We need to find the best approach to sharing the results of our study.

Is this information going to be made available to the schools for future educational improvement?  Are we going to try to publish in a scientific or educational journal?


\subsubsection{The Science Wheel Summarizes the above Steps}

The Wheel of Science  \citep{Wallace1971}
gives us a process to refine our thinking about the nature of social interactions.  See Figure 1.1.  We will define the four parts of the wheel below:  Theory, Hypotheses, Observations, and Empirical Generalizations.

\subsection{Example}

Let's look at another example.  Suppose we are interested in comparing the following four popular weight loss diets: Zone (balance between carbohydrates, protein and fat), Atkins (low carbohydrate, high fat, unrestricted calories), LEARN (low fat, based on national guidelines), and Ornish (low fat, high carbohydrate, unrestricted calories).   How would we design a comparison study?

\subsubsection{1.	Conceptualize the problem}

Which weight loss program is most effective?   Which one is the \textit{most healthy}?   Can \\ unrestricted-calorie diets make you lose weight?

\subsubsection{2.	Operationalize the problem}

How would we measure `effective' and `healthy?'  Do we look at weight \textit{loss} after two weeks? Two months?  Two years?  Do we compare the average weight \textit{loss} or percentage of people who lost 15 pounds or more?  How do we measure health?  By cholesterol reduction?  LDL cholesterol reduction?  Blood pressure reduction?  Glucose levels?  Percentage who feel better?

\subsubsection{3.	Design the study}

Where do we recruit our subjects for the study? How long will the study last?  Will we include only overweight subjects?  Do they choose which diet, or do we randomize the selection procedure?  How do we ensure that they stay on the diet?  Do we drop the cheaters from the study?

\subsubsection{4.	Collect the data}

How many times will we measure their weights?  How many times will we take blood samples?  Urine samples?  Do we send all samples to the same lab?  Do we measure how strictly each subject adheres to their diet?

\subsubsection{5.	Analyze the data}

Are there significant differences in average weight loss between diet groups?  Are there significant differences in the percentage who lost weight?  Are there differences in cholesterol changes, blood pressure changes, glucose level changes?  Are there differences in long-term adherence rates to each diet?

\subsubsection{6.	Conclusions}

Which diet would we recommend?  Under what conditions? Are our subjects sufficiently representative to allow generalization?  Are we sure the observed weight loss can be attributed to the diet?

\subsubsection{7.	Disseminate results}

How would we present the results of the study?  What tables and graphs would make the study easy to read and understand?

\subsection{A final product}

The following is a summary of a study reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Vol. 297, No. 9 in March 2007.  The paper is titled ``Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish,and LEARN Diets for Change in Weight and Related Risk Factors Among Overweight Premenopausal Women The A TO Z Weight Loss Study: A Randomized Trial,'' by Christopher D. Gardner, PhD, Alexandre Kiazand, MD, Sofiya Alhassan, PhD, Soowon Kim, PhD, Randall S. Stafford, MD, PhD, Raymond R. Balise, PhD, Helena C. Kraemer, PhD, and Abby C. King, PhD.  All authors were affiliated with the Stanford Prevention Research Center and the Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical School.

\subsubsection{Context}

\textit{Popular diets, particularly those low in carbohydrates, have challenged current recommendations advising a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet for weight loss. Potential benefits and risks have not been tested adequately.}

\subsubsection{Objective}

\textit{To compare four weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables.  Design, Setting, and Participants Twelve-month randomized trial conducted in the United States from February 2003 to October 2005 among 311 free-living, overweight/obese (body mass index, 27-40) nondiabetic, premenopausal women.  Intervention Participants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n=77), Zone (n = 79), LEARN (n=79), or Ornish (n=76) diets and received weekly instruction for two months, then an additional 10-month follow-up.}

\subsubsection{Main Outcome Measures}

\textit{Weight loss at 12 months was the primary outcome.  Secondary outcomes included lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), the percentage of body fat, waist-hip ratio, fasting insulin and glucose levels, and blood pressure. Outcomes were assessed at months 0, 2, 6, and 12. The Tukey studentized range test was used to adjust for multiple testing.}

\subsubsection{Results}

\textit{Weight loss was greater for women in the Atkins diet group compared with the other diet groups at 12 months and mean 12-month weight loss was significantly different between the Atkins and Zone diets $(P<.05)$. Mean 12-month weight loss was as follows: Atkins, -4.7 kg (95\% confidence interval [CI], -6.3 to -3.1 kg), Zone, -1.6 kg (95\% CI, -2.8 to -0.4 kg), LEARN, -2.6 kg (-3.8 to -1.3 kg), and Ornish, -2.2 kg (-3.6 to -0.8 kg). Weight loss was not statistically different among the Zone, LEARN, and Ornish groups. At 12 months, secondary outcomes for the Atkins group were comparable with or more favorable than the other diet groups.}

\subsubsection{Conclusions}

\textit{In this study, premenopausal overweight and obese women assigned to follow the Atkins diet, which had the lowest carbohydrate intake, lost more weight and experienced more favorable overall metabolic effects at 12 months than women assigned to follow the Zone, Ornish, or LEARN diets. While questions remain about long-term effects and mechanisms, a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet may be considered a feasible alternative recommendation for weight loss.}

The study tells us that all three groups lost weight.  Over 12 months, the Atkins group lost the most weight without increasing cholesterol, blood pressure, the percentage of body fat, or fasting glucose levels.

The study does not tell us that if one stays on the Atkins diet long term (say, two years, or five years, or 10 years) their cholesterol, blood pressure, the percentage of body fat, or fasting glucose levels will remain favorable.  If one ‘cheats’ on the Atkins diet periodically, what will be the effect on weight and metabolic profile?  Will the same results be observed for men?  For non-obese women?

Some studies are well designed; others are not.  It is often up to us to make our judgments about what is true, instead of leaving this responsibility to journalists or bloggers.  Whenever you hear a claim on television or in a magazine, ask yourself ``What is the evidence?''

\section{Common Fallacies}

A fallacy is sometimes defined as a mistake in basic reasoning. The following are examples of fallacies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Lack of evidence fallacy}

``There is no proof that the drug is unsafe.''  It allows claims to be made without providing any evidence, simply by shifting the burden of proof.  The fallacy lies in the reasoning that lack of evidence means the contrary is true.

\item \textbf{Anecdotal evidence fallacy}

``We give you testimonies of real people who $\dots$'' improved their golf game, or improved their sex life, or lost weight, or got rid of acne or achieved financial success.  They make claims without comparison studies.  Take a golf infomercial with testimonies from five golfers that a new driver improved their distance and accuracy.  Did it?  These are five golfers out of how many that they approached?  These are televised shots out of how many that each took?  The fallacy lies in the reasoning that existence means prevalence.

\item \textbf{Correlation equals causation fallacy}

For example, ``Married people are happier than singles,''  may be wrongly interpreted as ``Want to be happy? Get married.''  It may be that happy people are the ones who tend to get married, or that high earners tend to be both happy and married.  The fallacy lies in the reasoning that ``two things happening together'' must mean one causes the other.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Some fallacies in interpreting evidence} \index{descriptive statistics}

In medical studies, we use clinical trials to see if a difference exists between treatments.  We use statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant difference between the treatment types.  Perhaps there is very little difference, and that difference can be explained as being due to chance.  It could be there is no actual difference between treatment groups.  It leads us to a Type I error which can commonly occur.

A \textbf{Type I error} occurs when the researcher falsely finds a difference between treatments where no actual difference exists.  Often, we use 95\% confidence intervals when analyzing for statistical significance.  It means that 5\% of the time we may conclude a significant difference, when in fact one doesn’t exist!  The researcher is thus willing to accept a 5\% chance that the study conclusions could be wrong.  Notice, however, 5\% is very small compared to the 95\% assurance we have that there is a significant difference.

Another type of error that may be made is a \textbf{Type II error}.  Here the researcher fails to find a difference between the treatment groups when a true difference does exist!  Perhaps we did a study with only a small sample, and we didn't see a difference between our treatment and control group.  We would conclude there is no difference, which the treatment was not effective.  Another lab might perform the same type of study but have a much large sample size, and once they analyze their data find that there is a true difference.  If we fail to find a statistical difference when there is a difference, we have committed a Type II error.  It also relates to the power of a study.  The power of a study is related to the strength of the study.  Can we detect an effect when there is an effect?  How well was the study conducted?  It also relates to our sample size.  When we have a larger sample size, we will reduce the likelihood of committing a Type II error.

  \begin{solution}  % 1

1.  What might be wrong about these headlines?
  a.	A study proclaims: ``Slightly overweight people live longer than thin people.'' ``Slightly overweight people live longer than thin people.''  It is a fallacy of correlation equals causation.  It statement implies that being slightly overweight causes people to live longer when compared to thin people.  We would want to dig deeper into the study to see what confounding variables may be present: did we take into account health of the individuals?  Perhaps we have some individuals in poor health leading them to be thin and shortening their lives.

\section{Statistics and Data}

\textbf{Statistics} refers to a collection of techniques and procedures for analyzing data.  In this context, statistics may be considered a synonym of data analysis.  In a narrower context, `statistics' is sometimes synonymous with the numbers themselves, such as in `demographic statistics' or `baseball statistics.'  `Data' refers to any collection of measurements that a researcher makes on some number of subjects.  Researchers often store these measurements in a row-and-column display called a spreadsheet.  The following example shows a spreadsheet containing data taken on ten students in a class.

  \begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
  \begin{tabular}{@{} p{14mm} p{13mm} p{20mm} p{9mm} p{32mm} p{18mm} p{21mm} @{}} \hline % Column formatting, @{} suppresses leading/trailing space
   \multicolumn{7}{c}{CLASS DATA} \\
   %\multicolumn{7}{c}{Class Hours} \\
   Student & Gender & Level & GPA & Credit Hrs Taken & Transport & Hrs Slept \\ \hline
   1 & M & Sophomore & 3.10 & 32 & Car & 7 \\
   2 & M & Junior & 3.20 & 66 & Car & 8 \\
   3 & F & Senior & 3.49 & 94 & Bus & 8 \\
   4 & M & Senior & 2.68 & 89 & Walk & 10 \\
   5 & F & Junior & 3.73 & 69 & Bicycle & 8 \\
   6 & F & Junior & 3.39 & 59 & Car & 8 \\
   7 & F & Senior & 3.80 & 86 & Walk & 8 \\
   8 & M & Junior & 3.11 & 75 & Car & 8 \\
   9 & F & Sophomore & 3.10 & 27 & Car & 7 \\
   10 & M & Senior & 3.10 & 96 & Walk & 3 \\ \hline
   \end{tabular}
   \end{table}

Each row represents a subject (or student, in this case), and each column represents a measurement.  The measurement columns are also called variables because the values vary from one subject to another.

\section{Classification of variables}

\subsection{Levels of Measurement}

It is useful to distinguish between \textbf{four levels of measurements} for variables, from weakest to strongest: Nominal (no ordering), Ordinal (ordering exists, but not distance), Interval (distance exists, but not ratios), and Ratio (ratios exist).

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Nominal Variables}

Nominal variables are \textbf{categorical variables} that have two or more categories without having any logical sequence or order. For example, Gender is a nominal variable, since `Male' and `Female' are just names of categories.  Additional nominal variable examples include religious affiliation, language, and nationality.   There is no intrinsic ordering between these.  We often use bar charts and pie charts to represent these data.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item You cannot perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, \\ multiplication, etc.
\item No order or logical sequence is present
\item Only names
\end{itemize}
}}

\item \textbf{Ordinal Variables}

Ordinal variables are \textbf{categorical variables} with a clear ordering or rank.  A student's level of standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) is ordinal; they are also names of categories but, unlike gender, they are rank-ordered.   However, we cannot subtract them, and distances do not make sense.  Other examples of ordinal variables include Likert scale items in which we rank items.  Completing surveys or even end of semester evaluations we can rank on a scale of 1-5 (often from strongly disagree to agree strongly).

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Be careful about the size of the difference between categories may not be equally spaced.
\item Only order matters not the difference between categories
\end{itemize}
}}

\item \textbf{Interval Variables}

Interval variables are \textbf{numerical variables} where the difference between the two values is meaningful.  GPA is an interval measurement; we can subtract these measurements, and distances make sense.  For example, the distance from 2.3-2.4 is the same distance as 3.7-3.8.  However, ratios do not make sense; is 4.0 `twice as high' as 2.0?  The answer is no.  The grading system would work just as well on the scale (A, B, C)=(5.0, 4.0, 3.0) instead of (4.0, 3.0, 2.0).

\item \textbf{Ratio Variables}

Ratio variables are \text{numerical variables} with true zero.  Number of credit hours is a ratio measurement.  A student who has completed 90 credit hours has twice as many as 45 credit hours and three times as many as 30 credit hours.  Another example is the speed of an automobile which has true zero mph when it is not moving.  A speed of 40 mph is twice as fast as 20 mph.
\end{enumerate}

It is useful to recognize a hierarchy of information in the sense that \textit{a measurement level contains an amount of information greater than or equal to the level below it}.  At lower levels of measurement, data analyses tend to be less sensitive and sophisticated.  A statistical study should aim for the highest levels of measurement possible or affordable.

\subsection{Numerical versus categorical variables}

Interval and ratio variables together are often called \textbf{numerical} variables or \textbf{quantitative} because they provide a number which measures `quantity' (how much, how many) of something.

Nominal and ordinal variables together are often called \textbf{categorical} variables because they classify rather than count or measure.  It is tempting to think of categorical variables as `non-numerical,' but sometimes they do consist of numbers.  For example, `Social Security number' consists of numbers, but are used more as labels rather than quantities.  Hence, SS number is categorical.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Dependent versus independent variables}

Another classification for variables is dependent and independent. This distinction is relevant in studies that investigate cause and effect.  The independent variable is the probable cause.  We also refer to this as the predictor or explanatory variable.  The dependent variable is the outcome variable that is affected by the independent variable.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
In cause-and-effect studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{independent} variable is the probable cause.
\item The \textbf{dependent} variable is the outcome being caused/affected.
\end{itemize}
}}

The following is a description of a clinical study on the possible link between vaccines and autism.   In particular, the study tries to find an association between the amount of a mercury-containing preservative in vaccines and measures of brain function in children.   It has one independent variable (amount of mercury in vaccines) and 42 dependent variables (measures of brain function).  Similar to two previously published studies, it found no evidence of neurologic problems in children exposed to mercury-containing vaccines. \citep{thompson2007}
%The paper is titled ``Early Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years'' by William W. Thompson et al. (New England Journal of Medicine, 2007 Sept; Vol. 357, pp.1281-92).

%\subsubsection{Background}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Background}

Others have hypothesized that early exposure to thimerosal, a mercury-containing a preservative used in vaccines and immune globulin preparations are associated with neuropsychological deficits in children.

%\subsubsection{Methods}
\item \textbf{Methods}

William W. Thompson enrolled 1047 children between the ages of seven and ten years and administered standardized tests assessing 42 neuropsychological outcomes. We did not assess autism-spectrum disorders. We determined exposure to mercury from thimerosal from computerized immunization records, medical records, personal immunization records, and parent interviews.  We obtained the information on potential confounding factors from the interviews and medical charts. We assessed the association between current neuropsychological performance and exposure to mercury during the prenatal period, the neonatal period (birth to 28 days), and the first seven months of life.

%\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\item \textbf{Conclusion}

Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years.
\end{enumerate}

Among the 42 variables used to measure brain function tests on speech and language (comprehension of instructions, recalling sentences, stuttering), tests on verbal memory (no delay, short delay, long delay), tests on motor coordination (grooved pegboard, finger tapping), tests on behavior regulation (hyperactivity, inattentiveness), presence of tics (motor and phonics) and tests on intelligence (verbal IQ, full-scale IQ).  Most of these are numerical test scores.  Others are categorical, like the presence of stuttering (Yes-No) and tics (Yes-No).

Note that the researcher has a choice of whether to use numerical or categorical measures of brain function.  Even for categorical outcomes, there is a choice between nominal (i.e., Yes-No), or ordinal (Frequently-Sometimes-Never). Many surveys like to use the ordinal five-point scale:

{\small{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Strongly agree
\item Agree
\item Neither agree nor disagree
\item Disagree
\item Strongly disagree
\end{enumerate}
}}

It is called a \textit{Likert item}.  The scores from adding up several Likert items is said to be on a \textit{Likert scale}.  Western Michigan University's course evaluation uses a Likert scale on some topics.

\section{Summarizing Categorical Data}

The Census Bureau conducts a separate nationwide survey on population and information.  Called the American Community Survey (ACS), it is ``designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing.'' The ACS collects population and housing information every year instead of every ten years.  The following data is a sample of the actual responses to the ACS from the state of Michigan and Indiana in 2008.

The variables `State' and `Type of Payment' are categorical.  The variables `No. of bedrooms,' `Monthly Payment' and `12-month Household Income' are numerical.

\subsection{Relative Frequency Table}

A \textit{relative frequency table} gives the count for each category and the relative frequency or percentage of time in which each category occurs.  Here is a relative frequency table for Monthly Payment type.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{rrr}
  \hline
 & Frequency & Relative Frequency(\%) \\ 
  \hline
Mortgage & 44 & 58 \\ 
  None & 12 & 16 \\ 
  Rent & 20 & 26 \\ 
  Total & 76 & 100 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Relative Frequency Table for Type of Monthly Payment} 
\end{table}


To compute Relative Frequency, divide Frequency by the total and multiply by 100\%.  For example,

\begin{equation*}
RF(Mortgage) = \frac{\text{Mortgage Frequency}}{\text{Total Frequency}} = \frac{44}{76} \times 100 = 57.9
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Bar Chart}

A \textit{bar chart} is a plot of the relative frequency table.  We use bar charts for categorical data. The order by which the categories are presented in the bar chart is arbitrary. Sometimes they are presented in order of decreasing frequency for aesthetic purposes and is called a Pareto chart.  Some computing packages present the categories alphabetically unless otherwise specified.



{\centering \includegraphics[width=6cm,height=6cm]{figure/LBL2b-1} 

}




\subsection{Pie Chart}

A pie chart gives the same information as a bar chart, except in a circular shape.  We also use pie charts for categorical data. Some people prefer the look of pie charts over bar charts.  However, studies have shown that people have difficulty comparing the relative size of wedges.  When using this type of chart, we should only consider it when the number of variables is less than six, and we will use bar charts when we have more than six.  Look at the pie chart below.  Is Rent less than half or more than half of Mortgage?

\section{Summarizing numerical data}

Remember that the	\textit{mean} and \textit{median} cannot be used for nominal variables.

Consider the variable Monthly Payment in the ACS housing data on page 26.  How do the numbers appear?  How large are they? How variable is the data?  Are there any extreme values? These questions are attempts at getting to know the data.  In this section, we discuss tools for getting to know numerical data better.  We have n = 64 observations available since 12 households (out of 76) do not have monthly payments.  Here is a list of the monthly payments:

{\small{
880, 990, 750, 1400, 1400, 560, 900, 0, 380, 910, 1200, 1200, 450, 1200, 1300, 550, 340, 770, 700, 700, 0, 0, 0, 140, 220, 0, 650, 5200, 0, 970, 740, 500, 700, 1800, 800, 1200, 1000, 1200, 200, 710, 1100, 400, 370, 670, 350, 510, 0, 900, 0, 340, 440, 1500, 0, 420, 490, 2400, 0, 500, 200, 670, 760, 720, 0, 500, 280, 190, 1000, 250, 700, 380, 740, 0, 850, 530, 290, 230
}}

Now, we sort the observations from smallest to largest:

{\small{
140, 190, 200, 200, 220, 230, 250, 280, 290, 340, 340, 350, 370, 380, 380, 400, 420, 440, 450, 490, 500, 500, 500, 510, 530, 550, 560, 650, 670, 670, 700, 700, 700, 700, 710, 720, 740, 740, 750, 760, 770, 800, 850, 880, 900, 900, 910, 970, 990, 1000, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1200, 1200, 1200, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1400, 1500, 1800, 2400, 5200
}}

The smallest observation is \$140.  The largest is \$5200, which is an \textbf{outlier}.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{In data analysis, an \textbf{outlier} is an observation that falls far from the rest of the data. It may need to be checked for correctness if there is any possibility of clerical error.}}

Can this be a typographical error that we need to correct?  When we Look closely at the data, we see it belongs to observation 28, which is a mortgage for a household with a \$358,000 annual income.  We can infer that it is probably correct, so we leave it alone. The simple act of sorting the data already gives us more information about monthly payment.  For example, we can now see that the typical monthly payment falls around \$700.  We also see the extent to which the \$5200 value is outlying. We now turn to better ways to visualize the \textbf{spread} of this data.

\subsection{Stem-and-Leaf Plot}




Graphs are helpful in summarizing information in the data, especially for large datasets.  Below, we summarize two-year average percentage of persons living in poverty (2008-2009) in the U.S.A. in a graph called a stem-and-leaf plot.  The numbers on the left are stems, while the numbers on the right are called leaves.

There is one leaf for each observation, so there are 51 leaves in all, one for each state.  Our smallest observation is 7.4.  We write it on the stem `7' as a leaf of `4.'  We can infer that the stems represent tens and units digits while the leaves represent tenths digits.  We write the value 20.6 on the stem `20' as a `20' and the leaf as a `6', and so forth.  \citep{sullivan2013}

% Suppose we want to compare mortgage and rent.  Do mortgage payments tend to be greater or less than rent?  We can present stem-and-leaf for mortgage and rent side by side.

% In general, rent is smaller than mortgages and less variable.  While mortgages seem centered around \$700, rent is centered around \$500.  Furthermore, mortgages have a longer right tail, with a significant percentage over \$1000.  Plus, remember that we have removed a \$1800 - \$5200 mortgages from these plots.

\subsection{Relative Frequency Table and Histogram}

Earlier in this chapter, we presented a relative frequency table for categorical data.  Relative frequency tables may also be used for numerical data.  A relative frequency table for monthly payment is presented below.  The class width is chosen to achieve a moderate number of class intervals.

{\small{

\end{table}

}}

There are three things to keep in mind when constructing a frequency table. First, decide how many classes (i.e., intervals) we want.  This also determines the \textit{class width}.  Try to have 5 to 15 intervals, depending on how many observations we have. Second, decide where the first interval starts.  Third, decide how to avoid boundary disputes.

The last item requires us to choose a \textbf{boundary convention}.  For instance, the intervals in the frequency table above could have been written as follows:

\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}

\begin{tabular}{@{} l @{}} \hline
0-199 \\
200-399 \\
400-599 \\
600-799 \\
etc. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}

\begin{tabular}{@{} l @{}} \hline
$ [0-200)$ \\
$ [200-400)$ \\
$ [400-600)$ \\
$ [600-800)$ \\
 etc. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}

This way, it is easier to tell that \$200 belongs to the second interval, not the first.  However, the table looks more complicated, harder to read.  To keep the intervals simple but avoid boundary disputes, include a footnote to the table that describes the boundary convention, i.e. ``Intervals contain the left endpoint but not the right.''  Then, we know that \$200 belongs to the second interval, not the first.  Alternatively, we may use square braces and parenthesis.

It also means that the class intervals contain the left endpoint but not the right.  Which method do we prefer?

The relative frequency table is a compact numerical way to present how the data is distributed.  If we plot the frequencies as columns, the resulting plot is called a \textit{histogram}.

The histogram and stem-and-leaf plots look alike, except that the stem-and-leaf plot has columns that go sideways instead of upwards.  Stem-and-leafs are better if we want the data values themselves available from the plot.  However, the histogram can handle large sample sizes easily and is more flexible in choosing class widths.  For example, we may choose class widths of \$500, as follows: $[0,500), [500,1000), [1000,1500), \dots, [5000,5500)$, which stem plots cannot do.

\subsection{Dot Plot}

For moderately large samples, a \textit{dotplot} diagram is a quick way to see repeating data values.  We present the dot-plots of the resting pulse rates among college students before and after exercise.  As we observed using side-by-side dots plots, we find that the after exercise spread (maximum minus minimum) is wider than before exercise which makes sense.  We also see that six students of the 28 had a pulse rate of 68 beats per minute.

\subsection{Box-and-Whisker Plot}

A box-and-whisker or boxplot shows useful information about the data including the measures the central tendency and the variability of the distribution.  First, order the data from smallest to largest.  What is the range of the first (or smaller) half of the data?  The smallest quarter of the data?  The next quarter?  The box-and-whisker plot or boxplot is a graphical picture of the distribution of quarters of the data.  Consider once again the monthly payments from the ACS housing data.  We list them here sorted from smallest to largest (minus the outlier  (\$5200)).


{\small{

There are $n = 63$ observations.  One-quarter of the data is 63/4=15.75, or approximately 16 observations.  The boxplot below gives the range of each quarter of the data: the range of the first quarter (i.e., the lowest 16 monthly payments) is the left whisker.  The range of the 2nd quarter is the left part of the box, the 3rd quarter the right part of the box, and the range of the last quarter is the right whisker.

More precisely, the software draws vertical lines at (140, 400, 700, 970, 2400).  Hence, the lowest 16 monthly payments lie within (\$140, \$400).  The next set of 16 observations lies within (\$400, \$700).  The third set lies within (\$700, \$970).  Finally, the last 16 observations lie within (\$970, \$2400).  The five values (140, 400, 700, 970, 2400) that divide the data into quarters and form the fences and whiskers of the boxplot are collectively called the five-number-summary of the data.  They are often denoted as MIN, $Q_1$, MED, $Q_3$, and MAX respectively.

{\small{
\begin{enumerate}
\item	\textbf{MIN} is called the \textbf{minimum} and is the smallest of the ordered observations.
\item	\textbf{$Q_1$} is the median of the lower half of the data.  Also, the is the upper boundary of the first quarter and is called the \textbf{first quartile}.
\item	\textbf{MED} is the upper boundary of the second quarter and is called the \textbf{second quartile}.  However, it also divides the data into lower and upper halves and is more often called the median.
\item	\textbf{$Q_3$} is the median of the upper half of the data.  Also, it is the upper boundary of the third quarter and is called the \textbf{third quartile}.
\item	\textbf{MAX} is the largest of the ordered observations and is called the \textbf{maximum}.

Boxplots are particularly useful for comparing two distributions side-by-side.  Below are boxplots of mortgage data and rent drew parallel to each other on the same scale.  When comparing data of mortgages and rental, we find that mortgages tend to be larger than rent since the median and quartiles are larger.  There is also a considerable difference in the spread, with the mortgage data having a long right tail, evidence that mortgages have a higher ceiling than rent.

Different statistical computing packages have different ways of computing the quartiles, but the differences are minimal.  In this class, we compute the quartiles as follows.  First, arrange the observations from smallest (1st ordered observation) to largest ($n^{th}$ ordered observation).  Then

\fbox{\parbox{14.5cm}{
$Q_1$ is the .25(n+1)th ordered observation. \newline
MED is the .50(n+1)th ordered observation. In other words, the median is the middle value or the average of the two middle values \newline
$Q_3$ is the .75(n+1)th ordered observation.
}}

If .25(n+1) is not an integer, take the average of the two adjacent ordered observations.  Similarly, for MED and $Q_3$.  Here again are the $n = 63$ ordered observations of monthly payments.

Since .25(63+1)=16, then $Q_1$ is the $16^{th}$ ordered observation.  Hence $Q_1 = 400$.  Similarly, \\ 0.50(63+1)=32 so MED=700.  Finally, .75(63+1)=48, so $Q_3 = 970$.

If $n = 64$, then .25(64+1) = 16.25, so that $Q_1$ would be the average of the $16^{th}$ and $17^{th}$ ordered observations.  Therefore, if we return the \$5200 outlier we removed, then the five-number-summary would be (140, 410, 700, 980, 5200).

\subsection{Symmetry and Skewness}

The shape of the data is often described by its symmetry or non-symmetry (also called skewness).  Here are stem-and-leaf plots for \textit{symmetric}, \textit{right skewed}, and \textit{left-skewed} data.

The term `skew' refers to the direction of the most extended tail when you flip the stem-and-leaf sideways or draw a histogram. See histogram examples below. A long tail denotes presence of extreme or outlying observations.  The left-skewed histogram contains observations that are small and outlying, while a right-skewed histogram would have observations that are large and outlying.  A left skew also indicates that the smallest quarter of observations will be more spread out.

\section{Estimates of Center}

Suppose that a random sample of two-bedroom apartments in the Kalamazoo area yields the following data on monthly rent:

\$635, \$525, \$500, \$800, \$650, \$750, \$555, \$500, \$670, \$675

How much would we say is the average rent for two-bedroom apartments in Kalamazoo?  In this chapter, we will discuss the sample average and several alternatives to the average when estimating `average value' in a population.

\subsection{The Sample Mean}

The sample mean is the statistical term for `average of the sample.'  For the example above, the sample mean (denoted $\bar{X}$) is:

$$ \bar{X} = \frac{635+525+500+800+650+750+555+500+670+675}{10} = \$626 $$

so that the average rent in Kalamazoo may be estimated as \$626.  Note that this is an \textit{estimate} based on a \textit{sample}.  Therefore, it is subject to \textit{sampling error}.   Sampling error means that due to the luck of the draw, the sample average likely missed the true population average.  More precisely, the two-word term `sampling error' refers to $| \bar{X} - \mu |$,  the distance by which the \textit{sample} average $\bar{X}$  misses the population average  $\mu$.

The advantages of the sample mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is easy to understand and simple calculate.
\item It is based on all the values.
\item It is not based on the position in the series.
\end{itemize}

The disadvantage of the mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is always affected by outliers, which are relatively small and/or relatively large data values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Sample Median}

There are alternative ways to estimate average rent if we want to avoid the effect of outliers.  We can determine the sample median, instead of the sample mean.  We have discussed the sample median (denoted MED) earlier in Chapter 1.  It is computed as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $n$ represent the total number of observations.
\item Order the $n$ observations from smallest to largest.
\item Then calculate $0.50(n + 1)$ to locate the middle value of the dataset.
\item If $0.50(n + 1)$ is an integer, then MED is the $0.50(n + 1)th$ ordered observation.
\item If $0.50(n + 1)$ is not an integer, then MED is the average of the two adjacent ordered observations.
\item There are $n = 10$ observations in our rental data.  We first order them from smallest to largest.
\end{enumerate}

$$ 500, 500, 525, 555, 635, 650, 670, 675, 750, 800 $$

Now, $0.50(n + 1) = 0.50(10 + 1) = 5.5$.  Since this is not an integer, we average the $5^{th}$ and $6^{th}$ largest observations:

$$MED = \frac{(635 + 650)}{2} = \$642.50$$

The advantage of the median is that it is more robust than the mean, i.e., the median is not as affected by extreme values (outliers).

\subsection{The Trimmed Mean}

Since the mean uses all observations in the calculation, it can be strongly affected by outlying small and large values.  What happens to the mean when the smallest value \$500 is replaced by \$400?  It will become smaller.  What happens to the median?  It remains unchanged.

The trimmed mean is a compromise estimator that looks a lot like a mean but is less sensitive to extreme values.  The 10\%-trimmed mean removes the lowest 10\% and highest 10\% of the data, then take the sample mean of the remaining data.  In the rental example, 10\% of the data is one observation. We remove the lowest
observation (\$500) and the largest observation (\$800), and take the mean of the remaining eight observations:

$$\bar{X} = \frac{635+525+650+750+555+500+670+675}{10} = \$620$$

What if 10\% of the data is not an integer?  For example, if $n = 23$, then 10\% of n is 2.3.  Since we cannot remove 2.3 observations, we will remove three observations from each end (to ensure at least 10\% protection) and take the average of the middle 17 observations.


\section{Estimate of Spread (or Uncertainty or Variation)}

Recall the data on the monthly rent of two bedroom apartments in the Kalamazoo area:

$$ 500, 500, 525, 555, 635, 650, 670, 675, 750, 800 $$

If a future student asked us ``What should a two-bedroom apartment cost us in rent?'' how should we reply? Knowing that the data averages \$626, we might say something like ``Around \$626, give or take $\dots$(?).''   This second number, the give or take, is important because it says how much uncertainty there is in our guess.  In other words, the student's rent will probably miss \$626, but by how much?   We will get to the answer in a minute.   
For a second example, if we were going to San Francisco for a couple of days in August, and we want to know what clothes to bring, it is not enough to know that the average temperature is 68 degrees.  If it was 68 degrees, give or take 15 degrees, then we will need a sweater.  If it is 68 degrees, give or take 30 degrees, we might need a winter coat.

Variation presents itself everywhere.  Consider weight loss.  The 77 subjects in the Atkins group lost an average of 10.5 pounds `give or take' 15 pounds.  Compare this to an average of 3.5 pounds for the Zone diet `give or take' 14 pounds. How about in bowling?  In his first seven games in a tournament in Indiana, Walter Ray Williams Jr. averaged 228, `give or take' 34.   Notice how the `give or take' number seems to complete the description.

In this chapter, we will discuss the sample standard deviation, which is typically used as the ‘give or take’ number to describe spread in a group of numbers.

\subsection{The Sample Standard Deviation}

The standard deviation (or SD) is computed using a series of steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the mean.
\item Subtract mean from each observation. These are the deviations from the mean or "Deviations".
\item Square the deviations from the mean. These are the "Squared Deviations".
\item Take the sum of squared deviations, this is called the "Sum of Squares" or \textit{SS}.
\item Compute SD using the equation: $$SD=\sqrt{\frac{SS}{n-1}}$$ where \textit{n} is the number of observations.
\end{enumerate}

The table below shows the computations for the monthly rent data. Notice in the last row that the sum of the deviations from the mean is 0. This will always be the case for the sum of deviations from the mean.

\end{table}


$$ SD = \sqrt{ \frac{ SS}{n - 1}} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \ensuremath{9.764\times 10^{4}}}{9}} \approx 104.2 $$

It is helpful to get a feel for the numbers in the second column.  The first value 9 says that `635 is nine above average'.  The next number -101 says that `525 is 101 below average.'  Ignoring signs, the numbers in the second column represent the `give or take' from the average.  To get the actual SD, we take the Sum of Squares and divide by $(n - 1)$, and last, of all take the square root of that answer.  It gives us a final SD of 104.158.  We say that monthly rent averages \$626, `give or take' \$104.

Look at the second column again.  Ignoring signs, these are the distances from the average.  Which rental is closest to the average? The answer is \$635, which missed by 9. Which rental is farthest from the average?  \$800, which missed by 174.
What is the average `size of the miss?'  It should be somewhere between the smallest and largest, right?  It is how we interpret the SD: ``On the average, the monthly rentals miss the mean by \$104.''

Taken together, the mean and SD allow comparison of both relative size and spread of two groups of numbers.  In the professional bowling tournament in Indiana that he won in November of 2008, here are Walter Ray Williams Jr.'s first seven  games and last seven games (including the final):

\end{table}

What do the mean and SD tell us?  He averaged higher in the end but was also more consistent with a give-or-take of only 6 points!  His earlier games had more massive swings: from a low of 163 to a high of 279, resulting in the SD of 34.

\subsection{Effect of Multiplication and Addition by a Constant}

Recall that monthly rent for apartments average \$626 with an SD of \$104.  If the student plans to get a roommate and pay only half the rent, how much does he expect to pay?  If we are thinking of dividing both numbers by two, i.e., \$313 give or take \$52, this is correct.

\begin{center}
Original rent: $ 626 \pm 104 $ \hspace{2cm}	Half the rent: $ 313 \pm 52 $
\end{center}

Now suppose that the student does not plan to get a roommate, but his parents have agreed to contribute \$100 to rent each month.  How much does the student expect to pay after a subsidy of \$100?  If we are thinking of subtracting \$100 from both numbers, i.e., \$426 `give or take' \$4, there is an error in our thinking.  Here the SD remains the same, i.e.,

\begin{center}
Original rent: $ 626 \pm 104 $ \hspace{2cm} Subsidized rent: $ 526 \pm 104 $
\end{center}

If we are not convinced, consider the data itself on the following table.

\subsection{Risk ratio and odds ratio}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 In clinical studies, statisticians frequently take ratios of proportions or probabilities (instead of differences).  There are several reasons for this idea.  Sometimes, the disease or medical event of interest is quite rare, i.e., $p_1 = 0.0008$.  If a new treatment reduces the probability of getting the disease to 0.0006, the difference in probabilities is quite small and hard to assess $((p_1 - p_2) = 0.0002)$.  In the meantime, the ratio $ \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \frac{0.0006}{0.0008} = 0.75 $ means that the risk of getting the disease under the new treatment has been reduced by 25\%.

A technical reason for using ratios is that a ratio can control for other variables such as age and race.

\subsection{Risk ratio}

Following is the abstract of the study ``Safety and Efficacy of a Recombinant Hepatitis E Vaccine.''  % \citep{shrestha2007}

\subsubsection{Background}

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a significant cause of viral hepatitis.  We evaluated
the safety and efficacy of an HEV recombinant protein (rHEV) vaccine in a phase
2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

\subsubsection{Methods}

In Nepal, we studied 2000 healthy adults susceptible to HEV infection who were randomly assigned to receive three doses of either the rHEV vaccine or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6. Active (including hospital) surveillance was used to identify acute hepatitis and adverse events. The primary endpoint was the development of hepatitis E after three vaccine doses.

\subsubsection{Results}

A total of 1794 subjects (898 in the vaccine group and 896 in the placebo group) received three vaccine doses; researchers followed the total vaccinated cohort for a median of 804 days.  After three vaccine doses, hepatitis E developed in 69 subjects, of whom 66 were in the placebo group.  The vaccine efficacy was 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6).  In an intention-to-treat analysis that included all 87 subjects in whom hepatitis E developed after the first vaccine dose, nine subjects were in the vaccine group, with a vaccine efficacy of 88.5\% (95\% CI, 77.1 to 94.2).  Among subjects in a sub-group randomly selected for analysis of injection-site findings and general symptoms (reactogenicity sub-group) during the 8-day period after the administration of any dose, the proportion of subjects with adverse events was similar in the two study groups, except that injection-site pain was increased in the vaccine group ($p = 0.03$).

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

In a high-risk population, the rHEV vaccine was effective in the prevention of
hepatitis E.

The data given in the `Results' part of the abstract may be summarized as follows.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
 & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
 Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
 Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

We may present data for comparing proportions in a 2 by 2 table.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
 & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
 Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
 No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

The risk ratio also called the relative risk is the ratio of probabilities

\begin{equation*}
  RR = \frac{ \frac{P(Disease)}{Exposure}}{ \frac{P(Disease)}{No Exposure} } = \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{c}{c + d} } = \frac{p_1}{p_2}
\end{equation*}

For our example, we can define and calculate the risk ratio as

\begin{equation*}
  RR = \frac{ \frac{P(Disease)}{Exposure}}{ \frac{P(Disease)}{No Exposure} } = \frac{ \frac{3}{898}}{ \frac{66}{896} } = \frac{0.00334}{0.07366} = 0.045
\end{equation*}

It means that getting the vaccine reduces our risk to only 4.5\% of the original, or has 95.5\% efficacy.

% \subsection{A 95\% confidence interval for risk ratio}
% 
% We write the confidence interval formulas for the natural logarithm of RR.  Consider a 2 by 2 table as before.
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% We will calculate the confidence interval for RR in 4 steps.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Calculate the \textbf{natural log (ln)} of the risk ratio:
% $$ ln(RR) = ln \left( \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{c}{c + d} } \right) $$
% 
% \item Calculate the standard error of ln(RR) as follows:
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%    SE_{ln(RR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{a + b} - \frac{1}{c + d}}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item A 95\% confidence interval for ln(RR) is given by
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   [ ln(RR) - 1.96 (SE), ln(RR) + 1.96 (SE) ]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item Finally, a 95\% confidence interval for RR is given by
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   \Big[ e^{ln(RR) - 1.96 (SE)}, e^{ln(RR) + 1.96 (SE)} \Big]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Returning to our example,
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
% ln(RR) = ln(0.045) = -3.101
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
% SE_{ln(RR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{66} - \frac{1}{898} - \frac{1}{896}} = \sqrt{0.3462} = 0.5884
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%  [ -3.101 - 1.96(0.5884), -3.101 + 1.96(0.5884) ] = [ -4.254, 1.948]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%   \Big[ e^{-4.254}, e^{-1.948} \Big] = [ 0.014, 0.143 ]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% With 95\% confidence, the risk of getting hepatitis with the vaccine is only 1.4\% to 14.3\% of placebo.  It means that the vaccine reduces our risk by as low as 85.7\% or as high as 98.6\%.  Now read the Results section of the abstract again.  They say ``The vaccine efficacy was 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6).''  The two sets of the numbers match, (slight discrepancy due to rounding error.)

\subsection{Odds ratio}

The odds of an event occurring is

\begin{equation*}
  Odds = \frac{ \texttt{Probability that event occurs}}{\texttt{Probability that event doesn't occur}} = \frac{p}{q}
\end{equation*}

For example, if you win a game a 20\% of the time ($p = 0.20$), then our odds of winning is $( \frac{0.20}{0.80}) = \frac{1}{4}$.  We say that we have a \textit{1-in-4} odds of winning, or we win once for every four times we lose.  If we win 80\% of the time, the odds are $\frac{0.80}{0.20} = 4$. It means we have \textit{4-in-1} odds of winning, or we win four times for every one time we lose.  Here is a table of odds corresponding to various probabilities.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cc @{}} \hline
Probability & Odds \\ \hline
0.10 & 1/9 = 0.11 \\
0.20 & 1/4 = 0.25 \\
0.50 & 1/1 = 1.00 \\
0.80 & 4/1 = 4.00 \\
0.90 & 9/1 = 9.00 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike probabilities, odds can be greater than 1.  The odds ratio is just the ratio of two odds (usually for comparing two groups).

\begin{equation*}
  Odds Ratio = \frac{ \texttt{Odds of Group 1}}{\texttt{Odds of Group 2}} = \frac{ \frac{p_1}{q_1}}{ \frac{p_2}{q_2}}
\end{equation*}

Returning to the hepatitis E study, recall the disease occurrence data:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
 & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
 Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
 Placbo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

The disease rate for each group is

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)} = \frac{0.07366}{(1 - 0.07366)} = 0.07952
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)} = \frac{0.00334}{(1 - 0.00334)} = 0.00335
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Odds Ratio} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)}}{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)}} = \frac{0.07952}{0.00335} = 23.7
\end{equation*}

We say that ``the odds of getting hepatitis is 24 times greater if we remain unvaccinated.''

Odds ratios are generally easier to interpret if they are more significant than one.  We can always ensure this by choosing which group to put in the numerator, i.e., the one with more substantial odds.

It is essential to understand that the odds ratio is not a ratio of likelihood or probabilities.  If the disease rates for men and women are 0.80 and 0.40, respectively, then the odds ratio is

\begin{equation*}
   \frac{ \frac{0.80}{0.20}}{ \frac{0.40}{0.60}} = 6.00
\end{equation*}

In this example, men are twice as likely to get the disease but have six times the odds.

% \subsection{A 95\% confidence interval for odds ratio}
% 
% We write the confidence interval formulas for odds ratios (OR) for the natural logarithm, similarly to risk ratios.  Consider a 2 by 2 table as before.
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% The odds of disease occurrence in the exposed group is $\Big[ \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{b}{a + b}} \Big] = \frac{a}{b} $.  Similarly, the odds in the unexposed group is $\frac{c}{d}$.  Hence, the odds ratio of disease occurrence is
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{OR} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Disease|Exposed)}}{\texttt{Odds(Disease|Not Exposed)}} = \frac{a/b}{c/d} = \frac{p_1 / q_1}{p_2 / q_2} =\frac{p_1 \times q_2}{p_2 \times q_1}= \frac{ p_1 \times (1- p_2)}{ p_2 \times (1 - p_1)}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% If $OR < 1$, we can put the `not exposed' group in the numerator, so that $OR > 1$  (the resulting odds ratio should, of course, be interpreted accordingly).  In our hepatitis example, we can use the following table:
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% and get $OR = ((66)(895))/((830)(3)) = 23.7$ (``Placebo group has 24 times the odds of getting hepatitis''). If we use
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% then $OR = (3)(830)/(66)(895) = 0.04$ (``Vaccine group has 0.04 times the odds of getting hepatitis'').
% 
% In either case, we will calculate the confidence interval for odds ratio in 4 steps.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Calculate the natural log of the odds ratio:
% \begin{equation*}
%   ln(OR) = ln \Big( \frac{a \times d}{b \times c} \Big)

\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Know the difference between association and causation. 
 \item Understand how confounders can affect the results of a study.
 	\end{enumerate}
 }}

\section{Hidden Confounder}  \index{confounds}

In 1992, a research study ``Lower extremity fractures in motor vehicle collisions:
Influence of direction of impact and seatbelt use'' by Dischinger, P., Cushing, B. and Kerns, T. was published in the 36th Proceedings of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine.  It involved data analysis of the trauma-center population in Maryland.  Some of the conclusions were:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item there was a higher incidence of lower extremity injury in frontal collisions,
   \item seatbelt use was not effective in preventing lower extremity fractures, and
   \item there was a higher incidence of lower extremity fracture among women.
\end{enumerate}

The conclusion (3) is interesting.  It begs the follow-up question: ``Why do women have higher rates of leg fractures?''  Is it because they drive faster, or apply brakes more slowly, or have weaker bones?  It turns out that these are false questions -- they presume that gender is the variable that causes higher leg fractures.  

Researchers proposed an explanation in a follow-up study with the same lead author: `Lower extremity fractures in motor vehicle collisions: The role of driver gender and height' by Dischinger, P.C., Kerns, T.J., Kufera, J.A. Accident Analysis \& Prevention Volume 27, Issue 4, August 1995.

\begin{quotation}
Abstract: In a previous study it was noted that there was a higher incidence of lower-extremity fractures among women drivers. Analyses were based on a linkage between trauma registry and police crash report data. The present study addresses the issue of whether the differences noted are attributed to driver gender or are merely a reflection of differences in driver's height. An inverse association was noted between driver height and the incidence of lower-extremity fractures. Those shorter than average (5'7'') for this population had a 64\% increase in a lower-extremity fracture, which can be mainly attributed to ankle/tarsal injuries. Thus, the incidence of these injuries appears to be a function of driver height, with an increase among shorter drivers, most of whom are women.
\end{quotation}  \citep{dischinger1995}

It turns out that height was the culprit, but it initially looked like gender because height and gender have a strong link.  The following \textit{pathway graph} describes the true relationship:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\texttt{Height} & \Rightarrow & \texttt{Leg Fracture} \\
\updownarrow &  & \\
\texttt{Gender} & &
\end{eqnarray*}

But the association between height and gender led us to believe the wrong relationship:

$$ \texttt{Gender} \Rightarrow  \texttt{Leg Fracture} $$

The symbol $\Rightarrow$ represents ``cause-and-effect'' while $\updownarrow$      represents ``association.''

In this situation, leg fracture rate is the outcome, variable gender is the probable cause.  The hidden variable height is called a \textbf{confounder}, or a confounding variable.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\textbf{Confounding Variable:} \\
A confounder or confounding variable is a third variable that is associated with both the probable cause and the outcome.  It can lead us to a wrong conclusion about the cause-and-effect relationship.

\subsection{Apples and Oranges}

Now, why do unknown confounders belong in a chapter on threats to valid comparisons?  They are one of the most significant sources of (often unknowingly) invalid comparisons.  It seemed fair to compare leg fracture rates of men and women, didn't it?  What's wrong with that?  Unfortunately, concerning leg fracture rates, it was a case of comparing apples to oranges -- women as a group is shorter than men!  Of course, in the 1992 study, the investigators did not know that height would make a difference.  Women also tend to weigh less, smoke less, drink less, have longer hair, and wear higher heels.  Which of these would make a difference, i.e., be potential confounders?

Confounders are a big problem in comparison studies.  Some confounders may remain hidden, but it is critical that the researchers identify and control for potential confounders as much as possible.  Does smoking cause lung cancer?  When comparing smokers to nonsmokers, it is easy to show that smokers have higher lung cancer rates.  But as a group, they exercise less than nonsmokers.  They drink more coffee than nonsmokers.  Can the exercise or the coffee or the combination be the culprit?  Furthermore, smokers tend to be male, older, and drive in the winter with their car windows open.  There are plenty of confounding variables even in this comparison.

\subsection{In the news}

The STATS website (http://www.stats.org/) is dedicated to correcting ``scientific
misinformation in the media and public policy resulting from bad science,
politics, or a simple lack of information or knowledge.''  The following is an excerpt from an article written by Rebecca Goldin and Jing Peng in August 2010.  What is the confounding variable?  The probable cause? The outcome variable?

\textbf{If you take Viagra, will you get an STD?} \\
Rebecca Goldin Ph.D. and Jing Peng, August 2, 2010 

Judging from recent headlines, it seems clear:  ``Sex Diseases Tripled in Men 40 or Older Taking Viagra, Cialis, Study Says'' reports Bloomberg; ``Older Viagra Users More Likely to Get STDs'' says the Chicago Sun-Times, presumably comparing older Viagra users with older non-Viagra users.  And Health Day was even more explicit, saying ``Drugs Like Viagra Linked to Higher Rates of STDs.''  The next logic behind the claim seems persuasively apparent: if men who take Viagra are having more sex, then they have inevitably increased their risk of catching a sexually transmitted disease (STD). But is this the case?

The study compared men who took erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs with those who did not.  Researchers found that ED drugs such as Viagra are linked to higher rates of STDs among older men, but not older women, especially after the introduction of Viagra in 1998.  A study published in the July 6 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine was the first to examine the relationship between ED drugs and STDs. But its findings turn out to be far different than media accounts would have you believe.

The main problem in the coverage is the direct suggestion that taking Viagra is associated with STDs, as opposed to being the sort of person who takes Viagra.

There is a critical distinction. To see what it means, let's go backward in time and compare STD rates among people who plan to take Viagra but haven't and people who are not planning on taking Viagra. This quick comparison is what the authors of the research article did; they combed medical records for people who filled prescriptions for ED drugs and compared STD rates for these people before filling their prescription to the STD rates of people who did not subsequently fill a prescription for Viagra.  It turns out that the rate of STDs is higher among people who intend to take it.  In other words, the drug is absent, but those people who will take Viagra within a year are already at higher risk of STDs.

In fact, compared to those who don't take ED drugs, those who plan to take Viagra had a slightly higher rate for STDs, an odds ratio (OR) of 2.80; 95\% confidence interval CI, 2.10 to 3.75, than those who actually take it (OR) 2.65, CI, 1.84 to 3.81, though the difference was not significant. It means that the drug had no discernable effect on STD rates for this group of men.

The paper goes on with detailed analysis, but the main point has been stated.  To summarize the conclusions of the study:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Taking ED drugs do not increase the rate of STD's
	\item The type of people who take ED drugs are different from people who do not.

	\begin{eqnarray*}
\texttt{Person type} & \Rightarrow & \texttt{STD} \\
\updownarrow &  & \\
\texttt{ED drugs} & &
\end{eqnarray*}

instead of the (admittedly more sensational) relationship implied by the headlines.

\section{Randomized trials}

In the previous chapter, we covered unknown confounders, one of the most critical threats to valid comparisons in statistics. In this chapter, we will explore elements of study design that help statisticians deal with the danger of bias posed by hidden confounders. One of the most important aspects of many study designs is appropriate randomization in the selection of subjects for the study, and to different groups within the study. Without such randomization, results of data analyses can be biased. Let's see by way of example how randomization can help us address the threat of results biased by hidden confounders.

Recall the diet study discussed previously: ``Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN Diets for Change in Weight and Related Risk Factors Among Overweight \\ Premenopausal Women The A TO Z Weight Loss Study: A Randomized Trial'' by C.D. Gardner, et al. (JAMA, Vol. 297, pp. 969-77, March 2007)

\begin{quotation}
 \textbf{Objective:} \\ To compare four weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables. Design, Setting, and Participants Twelve-month randomized trial conducted in the United States from February 2003 to October 2005 among 311 free-living, overweight/obese (body mass index, 27-40) nondiabetic, premenopausal women.  Intervention participants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n=77), \\ Zone ($n = 79$), LEARN ($n = 79$), or Ornish ($n = 76$) diets and received weekly instruction for 2 months, then an additional 10-month follow-up.
\end{quotation}

Here is an example of a randomized trial or randomized experiment.   Subjects entering the test are randomized, using a virtual roll of a die, into one of several treatment groups.

The randomization into groups eliminates the main threat to valid comparisons: \\ confounders.  How?  By making the comparison groups similar to each other in all aspects, except for the treatment.  Think about it.  If you ask for volunteers to each treatment group, then most of the meat-eaters would go to the Atkins group, and most of the vegetarians would go to the Ornish group.   Would it then surprise you if one group had, say, more Asians than another group?  Or more smokers?  Or less physical activity?  Randomized assignments, instead of volunteering, is the best way to get balanced groups in the factors that we think might matter and achieves balance in all other factors we have not even considered.

Table \ref{tbl51} on page \pageref{tbl51} presents the characteristics (averages or frequencies) of the subjects after randomization, but before treatment has started.  Observe how randomization has achieved a right balance between groups in demographic and anthropometric variables (using either percentages or averages and standard deviations, respectively), and known health risk factors.  All other variables, essential or not, like IQ, shoe size, and preference for country music would also tend to be balanced, thus providing a level of protection against unknown confounders.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
To safeguard against potential \textbf{confounders}, comparison groups should be \textbf{similar} in all factors except for treatment itself.  \textbf{Randomization} is the best way to achieve the goal.

\subsection{Double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCT)}

Scientific studies should be randomized as described above whenever possible. But it might surprise you to learn that randomization is just one way to address hidden confounders and bias in clinical trials. The present section will cover \textit{controls and blinding}, two critical elements in study design that address confounders and bias.

Thus far, we’ve discussed how vital randomly assigning subjects in a study to groups within that study is to overcoming bias, but study designers should be aware that there is some luck involved in randomization. It is not always likely, but it is possible, that even the best randomization techniques leave unknown confounders present across all \textit{subjects} within the study. We may be selecting subjects for the study from a population where they all have a confounding characteristic in common. In such a case, it would not help us much to randomly assign subjects to different groups of the study since all the groups would end up exhibiting the same bias regardless as to how we assigned the subjects. Imagine attempting to conclude whether a medication is effective in treating the common cold by studying only subjects who have some particular resistance to the cold. No patients would get severe colds, or if they did, they would not manifest many cold symptoms like coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose. Sounds hard to study such subjects, right? Yes, the immune response confounder makes these subjects hard to explore, but this problem is solvable. Scientists need more \textit{control} in assessing such matters and their hidden confounders, so control \textit{groups} are added to scientific studies to correct for this problem.

Control groups are groups of subjects within the study that are not expected to respond in the same way as the treated groups.  For instance, control groups in medical studies are often groups of patients given inert placebos or ``sugar pills'' instead of active medications. Since the study directors do not provide these groups with the active medication, such groups are not expected to exhibit effects as strong as the treatment groups who receive medications.  We would not expect patients who receive sugar pills to miraculously feel relief from their cold symptoms in the same way patients who receive a new alternative to pseudoephedrine might. Even when such placebo groups do exhibit effects like the expected treatment effects, which can be due to the placebo effect or other hidden confounders (different resistance to the cold), the presence of these control groups within the study gives researchers a valid point of comparison. It is true that both the placebo and medicated groups selected from our cold-resistant population of patients would be asymptomatic. However, even though there is less sneezing when comparing the medicated and unmedicated groups, the response allows scientists to determine if it is just the patients' robust immune responses or the psychological impact of taking a pill is responsible, or if the medication is exceptionally effective at treating the cold.

   % \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

When one of the comparison groups in a study is a control group or placebo, randomized trials are sometimes called randomized controlled trials, or randomized controlled experiments. As much as possible, researchers try to conduct \textit{double-blind} randomized controlled trials, when neither the doctor nor the patient knows what treatment the patient is receiving.  In the common cold example, some patients get a sugar pill or placebo while others get a new alternative medication thought to treat cold symptoms.  (The critical point to remember here is that in a double-blind-controlled experiment both the \textit{patients} and \textit{doctors} have no idea if a patient is receiving the sugar pill/placebo or the cold medicine.) This method gives each patient a pill that looks identical regardless as to whether it is the inert placebo or the active drug.

\end{figure}
% \end{minipage}

Can you spot the difference? -- Single Blinding.  Can your doctor? -- Double Blinding. 

This double-blinding is essential because it offers additional protection against bias. In such studies, all groups have the same frame of mind (as opposed to knowing you are not getting the new drug). Similarly, the experimenter has the same frame of mind evaluating patients from each group. You might wonder, isn't it enough to single-blind the study, to make sure that just the patients are unaware whether they received the placebo or medicinal pill? No, it is not. Imagine an experimenter who administers both the placebos and medications but does so know which is which. That researcher might unintentionally treat these two groups differently, perhaps just by spending an extra minute with patients from the medicated treatment group or by approaching them with a little more enthusiasm. It's this sort of unwitting behavior that can invite bias into the study.

\section{Observational studies}

In many cases, the treatments being compared cannot be assigned, and hence cannot be randomized.  The study involving women and leg fractures is an example.  We compared leg fracture rates of two groups, men, and women.  Whenever a new subject enters the study, e.g., by having a car accident, we \textit{observe} what gender they belong to, instead of randomly assigning it to control or treated group.  Studies like these are called \textit{observational studies}, as opposed to randomized experiments.  In the hierarchy of scientific evidence, observational studies are not as reliable as randomized trials are regarded as the gold standard. Since the subjects of observational studies assign themselves to a different group, there may be a selection bias that leads to confounders (like the women in the leg-fracture-study being shorter).  We can control the effects of known confounders in the analysis.  For example, we can compare leg fracture rates of men and women with the same heights.  Investigators will need to anticipate potential confounders and control for them. We enumerate common reasons for nonrandomized studies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assigning treatment is impossible (e.g., to compare fracture rates between men and women, we cannot randomize subjects into the comparison groups).

\item Assigning treatment is unethical (e.g., to compare cancer rates of smokers and nonsmokers, we do not want to randomize subjects into smoker-nonsmoker     comparison groups.)  In other words, we do not want to force nonsmokers to smoke.

\item Assigning treatment is impractical (e.g., the outcome is a rare event like cancer or stroke, and a randomized trial would need too many subjects and too much time).  In cases like these, a case-control study is generally the way to go.
\end{enumerate}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\textbf{Observational studies} are conducted when \textbf{randomization} to treatment groups  \\ is \textbf{impossible}, \textbf{unethical}, or \textbf{impractical}.
}}

Returning to the leg-fracture example, we stick to observational studies in such a case for two reasons. As described above, it's impossible to perform the research any other way with the data collected. But we also \textit{should not} elect to collect the data in a randomized manner.  In other words, we should not even try to get the bias-reducing benefits of randomization because of ethical constraints. To perform randomized clinical trials in this study of leg fractures, we would need to randomly select subjects whose legs \textit{would} be broken for the sake of the study. Causing suffering like this is prohibited by several codes of ethics like the Nuremberg Code, a system of research ethics drafted after the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.  These criminals included scientists who designed and performed inhumane experiments. Beyond the official ban, though, such research is wrong in its causing undue suffering and its infringement upon fundamental human rights.

Another reason we may conduct an observational study is that they can be more practical compared to randomized controlled trials. It can be due to the constraints of a rare disease, or the cost of a randomized study would entail.  A researcher might want to study whether regular exercise can prevent a rare form of cancer.  Randomization and control here would require that we randomly select patients first, group them along exercise programs (say regular, irregular, and no exercise), and wait to see how the different groups respond (do the exercise groups have significantly fewer cases of cancer?).  This study might not work out at all because, since the cancer is rare, it's possible that no or very few of our subjects will get cancer.  It also may take many years before cancer would appear.

This study would be quite time-consuming and labor-intensive. Imagine all the financial resources that would be required to do all that exercise-monitoring over all the patients and years! This experiment brings us to our second point that observational studies are practical because they tend to be less costly than randomized controlled trials. Companies often use statistics to generate revenue, but they tend to do this not by randomized experiments, but by analyses of marketing data they collect through sales or surveys. Nonrandom observational studies like analyses of sales data are a relaxed approach in that all they require are a data collection apparatus and a statistician. For instance, clothing designers want to keep up with trends in consumer spending but might sell hundreds of different garments to thousands of outlets across the world. When sales of one item begin to slip, it might be difficult to notice amidst all the chaos of such a business enterprise. A statistician can help here by analyzing the proportions of revenue generated by each garment from month to month and making recommendations about which products to push when. The statistician might even find a style or color-based patterns that repeat themselves seasonally, allowing the company to adjust before their sales ever begin slipping.

\subsection{Case-control studies}

Instead of randomizing subjects into diet groups and then comparing the weight loss outcome, a case-control study would look for people in the population who lost weight, and then ask them what diet they used.  Thus, you start with the \textit{outcome} and then work back to the type of treatment.  These are also classified as \textit{retrospective} studies because they look back and compare weight loss or disease rates of various procedures.  Randomized experiments are necessarily \textit{prospective}, in the sense that you randomize treatment and then later see which groups lost more weight or had more disease.

We frequently use case-control studies because they are cheaper and easier to conduct since it generally requires a survey of a database, instead of expensive and time-consuming recruitment and handling of subjects.  There are plenty of successful case-control success stories in the scientific literature.

The first study formally linking lung cancer to smoking was a 1950 case-control study ``Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung'' by Richard Doll and A. Bradford Hill(British Medical Journal, 1950 September 30; 2(4682): page 739--748).  Using patients in 20 hospitals in London, they found that lung-cancer patients had higher rates of smokers than a comparable control group of patients.   For example, among district hospitals, 48 out of 98 lung cancer patients smoked 15 or more cigarettes daily.  In contrast, only 30 out of 98 non-cancer patients smoked 15 or more cigarettes daily.  

In general, case-control studies can conclude a link or `association' but are not able to prove `causation.'   However, case-control studies provide initial evidence that can generate resources for more rigorous studies like double-blind, randomized controlled trials.  In the case of smoking and lung cancer, randomized trials are unethical, but given the eventual results of multiple studies, the scientific community now accepts that smoking causes lung cancer.  
\citep{doll1950}

\subsection{Case-crossover studies}

Sometimes, a subject can be its control.  This method is called a case-crossover study because of subjects in the treatment group ``crossover'' to the control group.  An example is a 1997 study linking cell phone use to car accidents: ``Association between cellular-telephone calls and motor vehicle collisions'' by D.A. Redelmeier and R.J. Tibshirani (The New England Journal of Medicine, 1997 Feb 13; Vol 336, pp. 453-8).  The subjects were people who reported a collision to the North York Collision Reporting Centre between July 1, 1994, and August 31, 1995, Among these, 742 had cell phones and consented to participate in the study.  Instead of asking each person whether they were using their cell phone during the time of the collision (an unreliable method), the investigators examined their detailed phone billing records.  The results of the experiment follow below:

\begin{quotation}
Overall, 170 subjects (24 percent) had used a cellular telephone during the 10-minute period immediately before the collision, 37 (5 percent) had used the telephone during the same period on the day before the collision, and 13 (2 percent) had used the telephone during both periods. The crude analysis indicated that cellular-telephone activity was associated with a relative risk of a motor vehicle collision of 6.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.5 to 9.9).  The primary analysis, adjusted for intermittent driving, indicated that cellular-telephone activity was associated with a quadrupling of the risk of a motor vehicle collision (relative risk, 4.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 6.5).

	\end{exercise}
	\begin{solution}  % 2
	
Randomized controlled experiments are necessary to establish the cause of such a disease firmly. For instance, we might see if potassium deficiency causes the disease, we may give our treatment group a potassium supplement every day. However, if the illness is rare, then it is impractical for us to use a randomized controlled experiment.  It would also be unethical to be influencing or causing disease in people potentially.  Additionally, we would have no guarantee that any subjects would even develop the disease if it is sporadic. Thus, observational studies may be the most appropriate choice unless scientific advances in, say, genetics are far enough along to make a more practical kind of randomized controlled experiment.

A randomized controlled experiment is the ``gold standard of scientific knowledge'' so that it would be the best way to study this situation.

This method would, interestingly, give controls both from the standard and no-treatment groups.

Yes, there are potential confounders.

\section{Objective}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

\begin{itemize}
\item Define and explain the concept of the {\textbf{Normal Curve}}.
\item Convert empirical scores to z-scores and use z-scores and the Normal Distribution curve table to find areas above, below and between points of the curve and express them regarding their probabilities.
\item Utilize the standard normal distribution to solve probability (chance) problems.
\end{itemize}
}}

\section{Using the normal curve} \index{Normal Curve}

Best Buy wants to know how many smart fitness and GPS watches (like Fitbit, Garmin, and Apple) to order for their Kalamazoo location. Past data show that this time of year, they sell an average of 36 fitness watches per month, with a standard deviation of 8.

\subsubsection{Problem 6.2.1}  If they order 40 watches, what is the probability that they will run out of stock?

\subsubsection{Problem 6.2.2}  \label{LBL622} Given the cost of running out of stock and the storage cost of keeping too many, the manager decides to order enough smartwatches to cover customer demands 90\% of the time, i.e., there should be 10\% or less likelihood that they run out of stock. How many should they order?

Knowing the average and SD of a process $(36 \pm 8)$ gives us some understanding of what to expect.  However, the sales situation above requires the computation of probabilities, or chances, as in the ``chance of demand exceeding 40.''   This desired probability is the shaded area to the right of 40 under the histogram of demand (see the first graph in Figure 6.1).  Does this look like 0.20 of the total area?  0.30?  0.40?

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Probability of Demand Exceeding 40}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=14cm,height=7cm]{figure/LBL6a-1} 

}



\end{figure}

The normal curve (or bell curve) is useful in helping us calculate probabilities like these.  If we smooth out the histogram in Figure 6.1, it will look like a normal curve.  More precisely, it will look like a normal curve with a mean of 36 and an SD of 8, denoted as $N(36, 8)$.  So the shaded area on the left will be approximated by the shaded area under the $N(36, 8)$ curve on the right.  Do the two shaded regions look the same?

Of course, the areas look similar because, in our example, the histogram on the left looks like a normal curve.  It does not have to.  If it does not, then the approximation of areas using the normal curve will be wrong.  We should use the normal curve approximation with caution.

\subsubsection{The Standard Normal or Z Curve}

The standard normal curve (or Z-curve) looks like Figure 6.2, and has the following properties:

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{10cm}{
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item center is at zero
  \item The area under the curve satisfies the following: \\
  The area between -1 and +1 is 0.68 \\
  The area between -2 and +2 is 0.95 \\
  The area between -3 and +3 is 0.997 \\
  The area between $- \infty$ and $+ \infty$ is 1.00
  \end{enumerate}
}}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Normal Z-curve}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=9cm,height=9cm]{figure/LBL6b-1} 

}



\end{figure}

In general, area under the curve for \textit{positive Z values} can be found using the Z-table on \ref{TBL61} on page 82 at the end of this chapter.  


\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

  \item the area to the left of 1.25

  \item the area to the left of -1.25
  \item the area between 1.25 and 2.50
  \end{enumerate}
}
\end{minipage}

Are we ready to find the area under the normal curve in Figure 6.1?  Not yet.  The horizontal axis in Figure 6.1 is wrong for the Z-table, it does not have a mean of 0 (horizontal axis) and an SD of 1. Instead, it has a mean of 36 and an SD of 8.  The trick is to replace the $N(36, 8)$ horizontal axis with a $N(0, 1)$ axis, labeled Z.  See Figure 6.3.  Note that $Z = 1$ whenever X is one SD above the mean.  Similarly, $Z = -1$ whenever $X$ is one SD below the mean.  In general, Z is related to $X$ as follows:

  \begin{equation} Z = \text{number of SD away from the mean} = \frac{X - mean}{SD} \end{equation}

What is the probability of demand exceeding 40?  This is the area under the curve to the right of $X = 40$ or $Z = 0.5$ (see Figure 6.4).  Using the $Z$-table, this area is $1 -  0.6915 = 0.3085$.

\section{Calculating percentiles}     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We restate Problem 6.2.2 on page \pageref{LBL622} given at the start of the chapter.

\textbf{Problem 6.2.2}  Given the cost of running out of stock and the value of having too many, the manager decides to order enough smartwatches to cover customer demands 90\% of the time, i.e., there should be 10\% or less chance that they run out of stock.  How many should they order?

We want to estimate the number of smartwatches so that there is only a 10\% chance of running out.  Note that this is the 90th percentile of demand.

Looking at Figure 6.5, we see that we need to shade the upper 10\% of the area under the curve  .  What X value corresponds to the boundary?  When we use the normal table, the Z-value 90th percentile is 1.28.  What X value corresponds to Z = 1.28?  We solve equation 6.1 backward.

\begin{eqnarray*}
1.28 & = & \frac{X - 36}{8}  \\
36 + 1.28(8) & = & X-36 + 36  \\
36 + 1.28(8) & = & X  \\
X & = & 46.24 
\end{eqnarray*}

\newpage

The manager should have at least 47 smartwatches in the store.

\section{Calculating symmetric tail areas}

In later sections, we will need to calculate tail areas (or $P$-values).  For example, how frequently does a normal variable fall outside of 2.25 SD from the center?  We know a random variable following a normal distribution falls within 1 SD from the center 68\% of the time, and hence outside of 1 SD from the center only 32\% of the time.  What about 2.25 SD?

The area outside of 2.25 SD from the center is the combined area left of -2.25 and right of 2.25.  From the $Z$-table, the area to the right of 2.25 is 1 - 0.9878 = 0.0122.  Therefore, the combined tail areas is 0.0122 + 0.0122 = 0.0244.  A random variable following a normal distribution falls outside of 2.25 SD from the center only 2\% of the time.

\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

\textbf{For practice}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}

\parbox{6cm}{
  What percentage of time does \\ a normal variable fall outside:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item 0.4 of the mean
  \item 1.4 SD of the mean
  \item 2.4 SD of the mean
  \item 3.4 SD of the mean
  \end{enumerate}
}
\end{minipage}

\section{The Empirical Rule}

Figure 6.3 provides a useful interpretation of the SD.  We state it as follows:

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\textbf{Empirical Rule:} \\
If the data histogram is approximately bell-shaped, expect around \\
68\% of the observations will fall within \textbf{one} SD of the mean  \\
95\% of the observations will fall within \textbf{two} SD of the mean  \\
99.7\% of the observations will fall within \textbf{three} SD of the mean

  \begin{exercise} % 1

Researchers conducted a \\ study to determine if any link existed \\ between cellular phone usage and the development of brain cancer (don't worry, no connection was found).  Data from this study indicate that the daily cell phone usage for all users is approximately normally distributed with mean 2.4 hours and standard deviation of 1.1  hours.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item What proportion of cell phone users are on their phones between 1 hour
and 3 hours per day?
  \item To be safe, suppose you decide to be in the 5th percentile of
cell phone users concerning monthly usage.  How much time can you spend on your phone per day?

\label{chap:ch7}

\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

\begin{itemize}
\item Use the binomial distribution to compute probabilities.
\item Make use of the expected value and SD of a Binomial Random Variable.
\item Apply Binomial Probabilities Using the Normal Curve.
\item Understand that some Approximations Are Better Than Others.
\end{itemize}
}}

\section{Binomial Probabilities}

A sequence of n observations is called a binomial process if

\begin{enumerate}
\item each observation results in one of two possible outcomes (which we call    success and failure)
\item the probability of success is p, and the probability of failure is q = 1 - p for all observations
\item the observations are independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccc @{}} \hline
Obs 1 & Obs 2 & Obs 3 & $\cdots$ & Obs n \\
$p \swarrow  \searrow q$ & $p \swarrow  \searrow q$ & $p \swarrow  \searrow q$ & & $p \swarrow  \searrow q$ \\
S \hspace{3mm}   F & S  \hspace{3mm}  F &  S  \hspace{3mm}  F &  & S \hspace{3mm}   F \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Let X denote the total number of successes among the n observations.  Then
X is called a \textbf{binomial random variable} \index{binomial random variable} with parameters n and p. The following are all binomial random variables.

\subsubsection{Example 1} A Stat 1600 multiple choice quiz has five questions, with each question having five choices.  Let X be the number of correct answers (C) by someone who is guessing on all questions.  Then X is a binomial random variable with parameter values n = 5 and p = 0.2.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccc @{}} \hline
Ques 1 & Ques 2 & Ques 3 & Ques 4 & Ques 5 \\
$.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ \\
C \hspace{3mm} W & C  \hspace{3mm}  W &  C  \hspace{3mm}  W &   C \hspace{3mm} W & C \hspace{3mm}   W \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Example 2} Available data shows that 40\% of telephone respondents agree to be interviewed for market research surveys.  Suppose the polling organization Reliable Research randomly selects and dials telephone numbers until it reaches 50 respondents.  Let X be the number of respondents (out of the 50) who agree to be interviewed.  Then X is a binomial random variable with parameter values n = 50 and p = 0.40.

\subsubsection{Example 3} Historically, 20\% of buyers at Best Buy who purchase smart fitness and GPS watches (like Fitbit, Garmin, and Apple) also purchase the Geek Squad’s protection plan.  Suppose Best Buy sold 300 smart fitness watches during the previous quarter.  Let X be the number of extended protection plans that the retailer sold along with the 300 smartwatches.  Then X is a Binomial random variable with parameter values n = 300 and p = 0.20.

\section{Computing Binomial Probabilities}

In Example 1, the number of correct guesses may be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  How likely can a guesser get all five questions right? The answer is 0.0003, or about three times in 10000 attempts.  How about the likelihood of getting 2 out of 5 items right?  The answer is .2048, about a fifth of the time.  The following \textbf{probability distribution table} gives the likelihood or probability of each possible value of X.



\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccccc @{}} \hline
$P[X = 0]$ & $P[X = 1]$ & $P[X = 2]$ & $P[X = 3]$ & $P[X = 4]$ & $P[X = 5]$ \\ \hline
0.32768 & 0.4096 & 0.2048 & 0.0512 & 0.0064 & \ensuremath{3.2\times 10^{-4}} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

You can compute these probabilities yourself by successively substituting \\ $j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \texttt{ and } 5$ in the formula

\begin{equation*}
 P[ X = j] = \frac{5!}{j! (5 - j)!} 0.2^j 0.8^{5 - j}, \texttt{ where j = 0,1,2,3,4,5 }
 \end{equation*}

Remember that $0! = 1$ and $(0.2)^0 = 1$.  This formula is called the \textbf{binomial probability distribution function (pdf)} for $n = 5$ and p$ = 0.2$.  To compute the probabilities for Examples 2 and 3, you will need the binomial pdf for general $n$ and $p$:

\begin{equation*}
 P[ X = j] = \frac{n!}{j! (n - j)!} p^j q^{n - j}, \texttt{ where j = 0,1,2, $\cdots$ , n}
 \end{equation*}


\subsubsection{Example 3} (Cont.):  The retailer sold ten smart fitness and GPS watches in one day.  What is the probability that customers purchased three extended Geek Squad protection plans?  Using the equation above with $n = 10, p = 0.20$, and $j = 3$, we get

\begin{equation*}
 P[ X = 3] = \frac{10!}{3! (10 - 3)!} .2^3 .8^{10 - 3} = 0.201
 \end{equation*}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

\textbf{For practice}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{12cm}

Five percent of customers who rent video games from Gamers Retro Rental who return the rental late.  What is the probability that customers will return their rental late if 30 customers borrow a video game during the last hour?

\begin{enumerate}
\item 2 will be returned late
\item none will be returned late
\item 2 or fewer will be returned late
\item 5 or more will be returned late
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\section{Expected Value and SD of a Binomial Random Variable}

Suppose last quarter; Best Buy sold 300 Smart fitness watches.  If there is 0.20 likelihood of selling an extended protection plan with each smartwatch, the number of extended protection plans sold last quarter should be around 60 give or take 7 or so (we will compute this later).

We call the first number the expected value of the number of protection plans sold; the second number is the standard deviation.  Recall that X, the number of protection plans sold, is a \textbf{Binomial random variable}.  The \textbf{expected value}, denoted \textbf{E(X)}, of a binomial random variable X with parameters n and p is computed as:

\begin{equation*}
E[ X ] = np
\end{equation*}

The expected value $E(X)$ is also called the average or mean of X, and denoted $\mu$.  The standard deviation, denoted $SD(X)$ or $\sigma_x$, of a binomial random variable is computed as:

\begin{equation*}
SD(X) = \sigma_x = \sqrt{npq}
\end{equation*}

Returning to the example, since $n = 300$ and $p = 0.20$, we have $E(X) = 300(0.20) = 60$, and $SD(X) = \sqrt{300(0.20)(0.80)} = 6.93$, or approximately $60 \pm 7$.

The SD for random variables is interpreted similarly to the SD for a sample.  If the store sells 300 smartwatches sets every quarter, they won't sell precisely 60 Geek Squad protection plans every time; sometimes they will sell more, sometimes they will sell less.   By how much more, and how much less?  The answer is, ``By 7, on average.''   Similarly, a baseball player with 0.200 batting average won't necessarily get 60 hits in 300 at-bats.  We expect him to get 60 hits, give or take seven hits.

\section{Computing Binomial Probabilities Using the Normal Curve}

Beyond the empirical rule, we may apply the normal curve to approximating binomial probabilities.  The key image is a plot of binomial probabilities as a histogram.  For example, Figure 7.1 is a histogram of binomial probabilities for $n = 30$ and $p = 0.4$.

The height of the rectangle over, say 10, is its probability $P[X = 10]$.  However, since the width of the rectangle is 1, then

\begin{equation*}
P[X = 10] = \texttt{ height of rectangle over 10 = area of rectangle over 10}
\end{equation*}

What about $P[X \le 10]$?  This probability corresponds to the total area of the rectangles over and the left of 10 (shaded rectangles in Figure 7.2)

The total area equals 0.2915 using the binomial probability function to compute the area (probability) of each shaded rectangle.  However, this requires repeated applications of the binomial formula (11 times, in fact).  We may calculate a quick approximation of the desired probability by replacing the rectangles with a curve!  See shaded area under the curve in Figure 7.2.

There are infinitely many normal curves, which one do we use to replace the rectangles?  Answer: the one with the same mean and SD as the rectangles!  The (binomial) rectangles have a \textbf{mean}:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu &=& np \\
  &=& (30)(.4) \\
  &=& 12
\end{eqnarray*}

The (binomial) rectangles have a SD:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma &=& \sqrt{npq} \\
  &=& \sqrt{(30)(.4)(.6)} \\
  &=& 2.68
\end{eqnarray*}

Using the normal curve with the same mean and SD, the area to the left of 10.5 is 0.2877, which is a close estimate of the actual area under the curve is 0.2915.

Similarly, $P[X = 14] = 0.1101$ is approximated by 0.1115, the area under the normal curve between 13.5 and 14.5.

\section{Some Approximations Are Better Than Others}

Examine the shape of the binomial histogram for n = 20 and p = 0.10 in Figure 7.3.

Since the curve is right-skewed, we will get a poor approximation of areas if we replace the rectangles by a normal curve.  If the value of p were 0.90 instead of 0.10, the binomial histogram would be left-skewed.  It is typical behavior of binomial histograms whenever $p$ is either too close to 0 or too close to 1.  When is it `safe' to use the normal curve to approximate binomial probabilities?  A convenient rule of thumb is as follows:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The \textbf{Normal Curve gives reasonable approximations} of binomial probabilites whenever both $np > 5$ and $nq >5$.
}}

We remind the reader that the normal curve approximations are still approximations.  The binomial formula should be used to calculate exact probabilities whenever possible.

\chapter{Sampling Distribution of the Proportion}
\label{chap:ch8}

\section{Objective}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe and use the sampling distribution of the proportion.
\item Make and interpret confidence interval of proportions.
\end{itemize}
}}

\section{The Sample Proportion}

Suppose a student guesses at the answer to every question in a 300-question exam.  If he gets 60 questions correct, then his proportion of correct guesses is $60/300 = 0.20$.  If he gets 75 questions correct, then his proportion of correct guesses in $75/300 = 0.25$.  The proportion of correct guesses is simply the number of correct guesses divided by the total number of questions.

Similarly, if Best Buy's Geek Squad replacement plan sells 60 extended warranties with 300 smartwatches sold, then its protection plan sales rate is $60/300 = 0.20$. If it sold 75 protection plans, this is a sales rate of $75/300 = 0.25$.  The warranty or protection plan sales rate is merely the number of warranties sold divided by the total number of smartwatches sold.

Now, let $X$ denote the number of successes out of a sample of $n$ observations. If each response is a success with probability p independently of the other observations, then $X$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$.  Furthermore, the proportion of successes in the sample is also a random variable and is computed as

\begin{equation*}
  \hat{p} = \frac{X}{n} = \frac{\textit{Number of successes}}{\textit{Number observations in the sample}}
\end{equation*}

Since X is expected to be around $np$ give or take $\sqrt{npq}$, then $X/n$ is expected to be around $np/n$ give or take $\sqrt{npq}/n$, or $p$ give or take $\sqrt{pq/n}$.  Make sure that you agree with the last statement before moving on.  It may help to think of this analogy: Suppose annual rainfall in Kalamazoo is expected to be around 24 inches give or take 6 inches.  How do we change the measurement from inches to feet?  We divide both numbers by 12! In feet, annual rainfall in Kalamazoo is expected to be around $24/12$ give or take $6/12$, or 2 feet give or take 0.5 feet.  Now read the first sentence of this paragraph one more time.

Going back to the Best Buy example, the number of protection plans sold is expected to be around $60 \pm 7$.   Thus, the proportion of plans sold is supposed to be about $60/300 \pm 7/300$, or $0.20 \pm 0.02$.

We summarize the formulas for the mean and SD of X and $\hat{p}$ in the following table.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccc @{}} \hline
Random Variable & Mean & SD \\ \hline
$X$ & $np$ & $\sqrt{npq}$ \\
$\hat{p}$ & $p$ & $\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}$  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{11cm}

\parbox{11cm}{
If the local Best Buy store sold 1200 smartwatches last year,

\begin{enumerate}
\item the proportion of sets sold with extended protection plans should be around 0.20, give or take \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}}.
\item the percentage of watches sold with extended protection plans should be around 20\%, give or take \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}}.
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{minipage}

Data analysis sometimes involves percentages instead of proportions.  Proportions and percentages are two ways of saying the same thing (e.g., we refer to $1/5$ as either 0.20 or 20\%).  How do we convert a proportion to a percentage?  We multiply by 100\%.  To avoid repetition, we present all statistical formulas in proportions.  As Exercise 1 shows, we will convert all the answers to percentages in the end.

\end{enumerate}
}
\end{minipage}

Exercise 2 is an example of the law of large numbers.  A more straightforward illustration involves a coin toss.  If you toss a coin repeatedly, which tends to get closer to 50\% heads: 100 tosses or 700 tosses?  The correct answer is 700.  As the number of tosses increases, the closer we expect to get to 50\%.  The reason for this, as the Exercise shows, is the smaller give or take value.  The sample size, $n$, lies in the denominator of the SD of $\hat{p}$.  Therefore, the larger the sample size, the smaller the SD, which happens to be the give-or-take value.

\subsection{The Sampling Distribution of p-hat is Approximately Normal}

Since $\hat{p} = \frac{X}{n}$, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ looks the same as that of X except for different numbers on the horizontal axis.  For $n = 30$ and $p = 0.4$, the probability histogram of $X$ and $\hat{p}$ is shown in Figure 8.1.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Probability of Histogram and p-hat}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=8cm,height=7cm]{figure/LBL8a-1} 

}



\end{figure}

Therefore, like the binomial, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ may be approximated by a normal curve with the correct mean and SD.

\begin{minipage}[ht]{11cm}

\parbox{11cm}{
The question is equivalent to `What is the probability that$\hat{p}$ exceed 0.60?'  Using the mean and SD given in the formula above with $n = 50$ and $p = 0.50$, the sample proportion is expected to be around 0.50 give or take $\sqrt{\frac{0.5 (0.5)}{50}}$ or 0.50 give or take 0.07.  With a mean of 0.50 and a SD 0.07, the area to the right of 0.60 (under the normal curve with mean 0.50 and SD 0.07) is 0.0766.  Thus, the proportion of heads will exceed 0.60 fewer than 8 percent of the time.

}
\end{minipage}

\section{Estimating the Population Proportion p}

The Best Buy computations in the previous section assume that we know the protection plan sales rate is $p = 0.20$.  In data analysis, population parameters like $p$ are typically unknown and estimated from the data.  Consider estimating the proportion p of the current WMU graduating class who plan to go to graduate school.  Suppose we take a sample of 40 graduating students and suppose that 6 out of the 40 are planning to go to graduate school.  Then our estimate is $\hat{p} = \frac{6}{40} = 0.15$ of the graduating class plan to go to graduate school.  Now $\hat{p}$ is based on a sample, and unless we got fortunate, chances are the 0.15 estimate missed.  By how much?  On the average, a random variable misses the mean by one SD.  From the previous section, the SD of $\hat{p}$  equals $\sqrt{ \frac{pq}{n}}$.   It follows that the expected size of the miss is $\sqrt{ \frac{pq}{n}}$.   This last term is the \textit{standard error of estimation of the sample proportion}, or simply \textbf{standard error (SE)} of the proportion.

However, since we don't know $p$, we cannot calculate this SE.  In a situation like this, statisticians replace $p$ with $\hat{p}$  when calculating the SE.  The resulting quantity is called the \textit{estimated standard error of the sample proportion}.  In practice, however, the word ``estimated'' is dropped and estimated SE is called merely the SE.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{The population $p$ is \textbf{estimated using the sample proportion $\hat{p}$}.  This estimate tends to miss by an amount called the \textbf{standard error (SE)} of $\hat{p}$.
}}

\begin{equation*}
SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

\vspace{-40mm}

\textbf{Exercise 4}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{11cm}

\parbox{11cm}{

Fill in the following blanks.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If 6 out of 40 students plan to go to graduate school, the proportion of all students who plan to go to graduate school is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.  The standard error of this estimate is \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.
\item If 54 out of 360 students plan to go to graduate school, the proportion of all students who plan to go to graduate school is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.  The standard error of this estimate is \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.
\end{enumerate}

}
\end{minipage}

Exercise 4 shows the effect of increasing the sample size on the SE of the sample proportion.  Multiplying the sample size by a factor of 9 (from 40 to 360) makes the SE decrease by a factor of 3.  In the formula for the SE of $\hat{p}$,  the sample size appears (i) in the denominator, and (ii) inside a square root.  Therefore, multiplying the sample size by a specific factor divides the SE of $\hat{p}$ by the square root of that factor.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{As the sample size $n$ \textbf{increases}, the $SE_{\hat{p}}$ \textbf{decreases} like the square root of the sample size.
}}

\section{Estimating Population Proportion Using Intervals}

Variables tend to miss their expected value but should be within \textit{one} SD 68\% of the time, and within 1.96 SD 95\% of the time.  Since the SE of $\hat{p}$ is simply an estimate of the SD, then we can write $| \hat{p} - p | \le 1.96(SE)$ or that $p$ is inside the interval $\hat{p} \pm 1.96(SE)$ 95\% of the time.  In other words, the interval $\hat{p} \pm 1.96(SE)$ contains the true value of $p$ with 95\% certainty.  This method gives us an interval estimate of $p$.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{ \textbf{95\% Confidence Interval for p:} \\ A 95\% confidence interval estimate for the population proportion $p$ is given by

\begin{equation*}
  \hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}
\end{equation*}

}}

The term $1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}$ is the 95\% margin of error, $ME$.

\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

\parbox{11cm}{
Try the following problems.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If 6 out of 40 students plan to go to graduate school, the proportion of all students who plan to go to graduate school is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxxxx}}.  The margin of error is \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxxxx}}.
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval estimate for the true proportion p of WMU students who plan to go to graduate school.
\item If 54 out of 360 students plan to go to graduate school, calculate a 95\% confidence interval estimate for the true proportion p of WMU students who plan to go to graduate school.
\end{enumerate}
}
\end{minipage}

\section{Sample Size for Estimating the Population Proportion}
 
If 9 out of 25 randomly selected WMU students live in Southwest Michigan, the 95\% confidence interval for the true proportion is $\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}} = 0.36 \pm 0.19$.  This result says that the true proportion can be as low as 0.17 or as high as 0.55.  If we wanted to reduce the margin of error from 0.19 to some value $ME$, then we set the formula for margin of error equal to $ME$, i.e. $ME = 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}$.  Solving for $n$ gives the result we need.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
To be 95\% confident that the sample proportion is within a distance of $ME$ of the true proportion $p$, choose a sample size equal to

\begin{equation*}
 n = (1.96)^2 \frac{ \hat{p} \hat{q}}{ME^2}
\end{equation*}

where $\hat{p}$ is an estimate based on historical data or a pilot study.  The quantity $ME$ is called the 95\% margin of error for $p$.

}}

\subsubsection{Example:} Suppose we want to reduce the margin of error for estimating the population proportion from 0.19 to 0.10.  Using the estimate $\hat{p} = 0.36$  based on the initial sample, the sample size we need is: $n = (1.96)^2 \frac{(0.36)(0.64)}{0.10^2} = 89.$  To verify that this is the correct sample size, the 95\% confidence interval would be computed (if the sample proportion remained at 0.36) as $0.36 \pm (1.96) \sqrt{ \frac{0.36(0.64)}{89}} = 0.36 \pm 0.10$.

\section{Estimating the difference between independent proportions}

Has retention rate at WMU changed over time?  Suppose that a random sample of 200 entering students in 1989 showed 74\% were still enrolled three years later.  Another random sample of 200 entering students in 1999 showed that 66\% were still enrolled three years later.  This difference constitutes an 8\% change in 3-year retention rate.  However, the 8\% difference is based on random sampling and is only an estimate of the actual difference.  What is the likely size of the error of estimation?

Changing notation from the percentage to proportions and taking the difference of
0.74 - 0.66, we get 0.08 to compare retention rates.  The proportions of 0.74 and 0.66 are \textit{independent} proportions, in the sense that we base them on separate and independent groups of students.  The SE of the difference is

\begin{equation*}
  SE_{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} = \sqrt{ SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2}
\end{equation*}

Whenever the two proportions are independent.  Applying equation SE of $\hat{p} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p} \hat{q} }{n}}$ twice, we have $SE_{\hat{p}_1} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p}_1 \hat{q}_1 }{n_1}}$ and $SE_{\hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p}_2 \hat{q}_2 }{n_2}}$.  Substituting into the formula above, $SE_{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} = \sqrt{ SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2}$, we get:

\fbox{\parbox{13cm}{
\textbf{Standard Error of the Difference between two independent Proportions}

\begin{equation*}
  SE_{( \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p}_1 \hat{q}_1}{n_1} + \frac{ \hat{p}_2 \hat{q}_2}{n_2}}
\end{equation*}
}}

Continuing with the retention rate example, we let $\hat{p}_1 = 0.74$, $\hat{p}_2 = 0.66$, $n_1 = 200$, $n_2 = 200$ so that

$$ SE_{( \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} = \sqrt{ \frac{ 0.74 (0.26)}{200} + \frac{ 0.66 (0.34) }{200}} = 0.045 $$

Thus, the difference in retention rate is estimated by $0.74 - 0.66 = 0.08$ with a standard error of 0.045.  Changing notation back to a percentage and with less technical language, the drop-in retention rate is estimated to be 8\%, give or take 4.5\% or so. We also could have computed $ SE_{( \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)}$  in three steps.  First by using $SE_{\hat{p}}$ twice,

\begin{minipage}[ht]{7cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
  SE_{\hat{p}_1} &=& \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1 \hat{q}_1}{n_1}} \\
  &=& \sqrt{ \frac{0.74  (0.26)}{200}} \\
  &=& 0.031
\end{eqnarray*} 

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{7cm}

\begin{eqnarray*}
  SE_{\hat{p}_2} &=& \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_2 \hat{q}_2}{n_2}} \\ 
  &=& \sqrt{ \frac{0.66  (0.34)}{200}} \\
  &=& 0.033
\end{eqnarray*}  

\end{minipage}

\vspace{1cm}

Then using $ SE_{( \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} = \sqrt{ SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2} = \sqrt{ (0.031)^2 + (0.033)^2} = 0.045 $

\subsection{Using a confidence interval}

The difference of two proportions is a random variable with an expected value and spread.  The 68\% and 95\% rules apply, i.e.  the estimated difference $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ should be close to the true value -- within \textit{one} SE 68\% of the time, and within 1.96 SE's 95\% of the time.  Following the same reasoning as before,

\begin{equation*}
  (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm 1.96 (SE_{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)})
\end{equation*}

should contain the true difference $p_1 - p_2$ with 95\% level of confidence.  Substituting
$$ SE_{( \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p}_1 \hat{q}_1}{n_1} + \frac{ \hat{p}_2 \hat{q}_2}{n_2}} $$,
we get the following formula:

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{13cm}{
\textbf{95\% Confidence Interval for $p_1 - p_2$}

\begin{equation*}
  ( \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{ \hat{p}_1 \hat{q}_1}{n_1} + \frac{ \hat{p}_2 \hat{q}_2}{n_2}}
\end{equation*}
}}
\end{center}

For retention rate, the difference between 1989 and 1999 the department estimated as 0.08 with SE = 0.045.  Therefore, a 95\% confidence interval for the change is

\begin{equation*}
0.08 \pm 1.96 (0.045)
\end{equation*}

or $0.08 \pm 0.088 = (-0.008, 0.168)$.  Rounding off to $(-0.01, 0.17)$, we say that the drop-in retention rate from 1989 to 1999 is between $-0.01 \texttt{ and } 0.17$ with 95\% confidence. Note that \textbf{zero} is contained or is not been excluded from the interval, making it still a possibility that there is no real change in retention rate, just chance variability.

\section{Statistical significance}

Let $\hat{p}_1$ be the proportion of heads in 50 tosses of a coin.  Let $\hat{p}_2$  be the proportion of heads in the next 50 tosses of the same coin.  Will $\hat{p}_1$  and $\hat{p}_1$ be equal?  Not likely.  They will tend to differ, due to ``the luck of the draw'' or chance variability.

The table below shows partial data from an occupation survey by the Census Bureau. In this 2009 survey, regular `cooks' were a separate classification from `chefs or head cooks.'  Note that even though 37\% of cooks were women, only 16\% of chefs or head cooks were women.  Is the difference just luck of the draw, or due to something else besides chance?

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
       & Women & Men & Total \\ \hline
Cooks & 441 & 762 & 1203 \\
Chefs or Head Cooks & 45 & 245 & 290 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Statistics help decision-making in cases like these by assessing how much chance variability to expect between two proportions.  Following the calculations of the section above, we have

\vspace{4mm}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{7cm}

difference: 

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 &=& \frac{441}{1203} - \frac{45}{290} \\
    &=& 0.37 - 0.16 \\
    &=& 0.21
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{7cm}

with a standard error:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  SE_{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)} &=& \sqrt{ \frac{0.37(0.63)}{1203} + \frac{0.16(0.84}{290}} \\
  &=& 0.026
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{5mm}

The 95\% confidence interval for $p_1 - p_2$ is

\begin{equation*}
0.21 \pm 1.96 (0.026) = (0.16, 0.26)
\end{equation*}

Thus, even allowing for 1.96 SE's of chance variability, the actual difference between proportions is at least 0.16 (and could be as large as 0.26).  This difference means that the interval does not contain or it excluded 0 from the range of possible values.  When this happens, statisticians say that the differences are \textit{statistically significant}.

\fbox{\parbox{13cm}{
If the confidence interval for $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ excludes \textbf{zero}, then the difference is \textbf{statistically significant.}

}}

\subsection{The P-value}

For convenience, let us continue the example of the previous section.

\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

\vspace{-4mm}

\textbf{Question}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{12cm}

\parbox{12cm}{
If chance alone was at work, how likely will we get a difference of 0.21 between two proportions?
}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

\vspace{-3mm}

\textbf{Answer}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{12cm}

\parbox{12cm}{
Very small, less than 0.0001 (or 1 in 10,000).
}
\end{minipage}

The `likelihood of getting 0.21 by chance' is called a P-value. The fact that it is minimal means we should exclude the option that `chance alone is at work.'

The actual probability calculation is beyond the scope of this class.  Let's say that random variables very rarely go past 4 SE's from their expected values (less than 1 in 10,000 times).  Since the SE for the difference is 0.026, the observed difference $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = 0.21$  is not just 1, nor 2, but 8 SE's from 0.  This difference cannot be chance alone.   Something else is at work.

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{12cm}{
\textbf{The Rule for $p$-value:} \\
If the $p$-value $\le 0.05$, the difference is \textit{statistically significant.} \\
If the $p$-value $\le 0.01$, the difference is called \textit{highly significant.}
}}
\end{center}

In the occupation example, we can say that the percentage of women head chefs
is lower than that of regular cooks.  Furthermore, the difference is highly significant.

% \subsection{Risk ratio and odds ratio}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  In clinical studies, statisticians frequently take ratios of proportions or probabilities (instead of differences).  There are several reasons for this idea.  Sometimes, the disease or medical event of interest is quite rare, i.e., $p_1 = 0.0008$.  If a new treatment reduces the probability of getting the disease to 0.0006, the difference in probabilities is quite small and hard to assess $((p_1 - p_2) = 0.0002)$.  In the meantime, the ratio $ \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \frac{0.0006}{0.0008} = 0.75 $ means that the risk of getting the disease under the new treatment has been reduced by 25\%.
%
% A technical reason for using ratios is that a ratio can control for other variables such as age and race.
%
% \subsection{Risk ratio}
%
% Following is the abstract of the study ``Safety and Efficacy of a Recombinant Hepatitis E Vaccine.''  % \citep{shrestha2007}
%
% \subsubsection{Background}
%
% Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a significant cause of viral hepatitis.  We evaluated
% the safety and efficacy of an HEV recombinant protein (rHEV) vaccine in a phase
% 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
%
% \subsubsection{Methods}
%
% In Nepal, we studied 2000 healthy adults susceptible to HEV infection who were randomly assigned to receive three doses of either the rHEV vaccine or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6. Active (including hospital) surveillance was used to identify acute hepatitis and adverse events. The primary endpoint was the development of hepatitis E after three vaccine doses.
%
% \subsubsection{Results}
%
% A total of 1794 subjects (898 in the vaccine group and 896 in the placebo group) received three vaccine doses; researchers followed the total vaccinated cohort for a median of 804 days.  After three vaccine doses, hepatitis E developed in 69 subjects, of whom 66 were in the placebo group.  The vaccine efficacy was 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6).  In an intention-to-treat analysis that included all 87 subjects in whom hepatitis E developed after the first vaccine dose, nine subjects were in the vaccine group, with a vaccine efficacy of 88.5\% (95\% CI, 77.1 to 94.2).  Among subjects in a sub-group randomly selected for analysis of injection-site findings and general symptoms (reactogenicity sub-group) during the 8-day period after the administration of any dose, the proportion of subjects with adverse events was similar in the two study groups, except that injection-site pain was increased in the vaccine group ($p = 0.03$).
%
% \subsubsection{Conclusion}
%
% In a high-risk population, the rHEV vaccine was effective in the prevention of
% hepatitis E.
%
% The data given in the `Results' part of the abstract may be summarized as follows.
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% We may present data for comparing proportions in a 2 by 2 table.
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% The risk ratio also called the relative risk is the ratio of probabilities
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   RR = \frac{ \frac{P(Disease)}{Exposure}}{ \frac{P(Disease)}{No Exposure} } = \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{c}{c + d} } = \frac{p_1}{p_2}
% \end{equation*}
%
% For our example, we can define and calculate the risk ratio as
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   RR = \frac{ \frac{P(Disease)}{Exposure}}{ \frac{P(Disease)}{No Exposure} } = \frac{ \frac{3}{898}}{ \frac{66}{896} } = \frac{0.00334}{0.07366} = 0.045
% \end{equation*}
%
% It means that getting the vaccine reduces our risk to only 4.5\% of the original, or has 95.5\% efficacy.
%
% \subsection{A 95\% confidence interval for risk ratio}
%
% We write the confidence interval formulas for the natural logarithm of RR.  Consider a 2 by 2 table as before.
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% We will calculate the confidence interval for RR in 4 steps.
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Calculate the \textbf{natural log (ln)} of the risk ratio:
% $$ ln(RR) = ln \left( \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{c}{c + d} } \right) $$
%
% \item Calculate the standard error of ln(RR) as follows:
%
% \begin{equation*}
%    SE_{ln(RR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{a + b} - \frac{1}{c + d}}
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item A 95\% confidence interval for ln(RR) is given by
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   [ ln(RR) - 1.96 (SE), ln(RR) + 1.96 (SE) ]
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item Finally, a 95\% confidence interval for RR is given by
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   \Big[ e^{ln(RR) - 1.96 (SE)}, e^{ln(RR) + 1.96 (SE)} \Big]
% \end{equation*}
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
% Returning to our example,
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
% ln(RR) = ln(0.045) = -3.101
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
% SE_{ln(RR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{66} - \frac{1}{898} - \frac{1}{896}} = \sqrt{0.3462} = 0.5884
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%  [ -3.101 - 1.96(0.5884), -3.101 + 1.96(0.5884) ] = [ -4.254, 1.948]
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%   \Big[ e^{-4.254}, e^{-1.948} \Big] = [ 0.014, 0.143 ]
% \end{equation*}
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
% With 95\% confidence, the risk of getting hepatitis with the vaccine is only 1.4\% to 14.3\% of placebo.  It means that the vaccine reduces our risk by as low as 85.7\% or as high as 98.6\%.  Now read the Results section of the abstract again.  They say ``The vaccine efficacy was 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6).''  The two sets of the numbers match, (slight discrepancy due to rounding error.)
%
% \subsection{Odds ratio}
%
% The odds of an event occurring is
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   Odds = \frac{ \texttt{Probability that event occurs}}{\texttt{Probability that event doesn't occur}} = \frac{p}{q}
% \end{equation*}
%
% For example, if you win a game a 20\% of the time ($p = 0.20$), then our odds of winning is $( \frac{0.20}{0.80}) = \frac{1}{4}$.  We say that we have a \textit{1-in-4} odds of winning, or we win once for every four times we lose.  If we win 80\% of the time, the odds are $\frac{0.80}{0.20} = 4$. It means we have \textit{4-in-1} odds of winning, or we win four times for every one time we lose.  Here is a table of odds corresponding to various probabilities.

% Unlike probabilities, odds can be greater than 1.  The odds ratio is just the ratio of two odds (usually for comparing two groups).
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   Odds Ratio = \frac{ \texttt{Odds of Group 1}}{\texttt{Odds of Group 2}} = \frac{ \frac{p_1}{q_1}}{ \frac{p_2}{q_2}}
% \end{equation*}
%
% Returning to the hepatitis E study, recall the disease occurrence data:
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%  Placbo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% The disease rate for each group is
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)} = \frac{0.07366}{(1 - 0.07366)} = 0.07952
% \end{equation*}
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)} = \frac{0.00334}{(1 - 0.00334)} = 0.00335
% \end{equation*}
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{Odds Ratio} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)}}{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)}} = \frac{0.07952}{0.00335} = 23.7
% \end{equation*}
%
% We say that ``the odds of getting hepatitis is 24 times greater if we remain unvaccinated.''
%
% Odds ratios are generally easier to interpret if they are more significant than one.  We can always ensure this by choosing which group to put in the numerator, i.e., the one with more substantial odds.
%
% It is essential to understand that the odds ratio is not a ratio of likelihood or probabilities.  If the disease rates for men and women are 0.80 and 0.40, respectively, then the odds ratio is
%
% \begin{equation*}
%    \frac{ \frac{0.80}{0.20}}{ \frac{0.40}{0.60}} = 6.00
% \end{equation*}
%
% In this example, men are twice as likely to get the disease but have six times the odds.
%
% \subsection{A 95\% confidence interval for odds ratio}
%
% We write the confidence interval formulas for odds ratios (OR) for the natural logarithm, similarly to risk ratios.  Consider a 2 by 2 table as before.
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% The odds of disease occurrence in the exposed group is $\Big[ \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{b}{a + b}} \Big] = \frac{a}{b} $.  Similarly, the odds in the unexposed group is $\frac{c}{d}$.  Hence, the odds ratio of disease occurrence is
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{OR} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Disease|Exposed)}}{\texttt{Odds(Disease|Not Exposed)}} = \frac{a/b}{c/d} = \frac{p_1 / q_1}{p_2 / q_2} =\frac{p_1 \times q_2}{p_2 \times q_1}= \frac{ p_1 \times (1- p_2)}{ p_2 \times (1 - p_1)}
% \end{equation*}
%
% If $OR < 1$, we can put the `not exposed' group in the numerator, so that $OR > 1$  (the resulting odds ratio should, of course, be interpreted accordingly).  In our hepatitis example, we can use the following table:
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% and get $OR = ((66)(895))/((830)(3)) = 23.7$ (``Placebo group has 24 times the odds of getting hepatitis''). If we use
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% then $OR = (3)(830)/(66)(895) = 0.04$ (``Vaccine group has 0.04 times the odds of getting hepatitis'').
%
% In either case, we will calculate the confidence interval for odds ratio in 4 steps.
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Calculate the natural log of the odds ratio:
% \begin{equation*}
%   ln(OR) = ln \Big( \frac{a \times d}{b \times c} \Big)
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item	Calculate the standard error of ln(OR) as follows:
% \begin{equation*}
%   SE_{ln(OR)} = \sqrt{ \Big( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \Big)}
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item A 95\% confidence interval for ln(OR) is given by
% \begin{equation*}
%   [ ln(OR) - 1.96(SE), ln(OR) + 1.96(SE)]
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item Finally, a 95\% confidence interval for OR is given by
% \begin{equation*}
%    e^{ln(OR) - 1.96(SE)}, e^{ln(OR) + 1.96(SE)}
% \end{equation*}
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
% Returning to the hepatitis E study, recall the disease occurrence data:
%
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Placbo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
%
% The odds ratio of getting hepatitis is
%
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{Odds Ratio} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)}}{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)}} = \frac{66 \times 895}{3 \times 830} = 23.7
% \end{equation*}
%
% so that
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%   ln(OR) = ln(23.7) = 3.165
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%   SE_{ln(OR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{66} + \frac{1}{830} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{895}   } = \sqrt{0.3508} = 0.5923
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%  [3.165-1.96 (0.5923), 3.165+1.96 (.5923)] = [2.004, 4.326]
% \end{equation*}
%
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%   [ e^{2.004}, e^{4.326} ] = [ 7.419, 75.641]
% \end{equation*}
% \end{enumerate}
%
% With 95\% confidence, the odds of unvaccinated subjects getting hepatitis is between 7 and 76 times greater than vaccinated subjects.

\chapter{More Comparing of Two Proportions} 

\label{chap:ch10}

\section{Objective}

After completing this part, we should be able to:

\vspace{1mm}

% \colorbox{yellow}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

\begin{itemize}
\item Set-up the hypotheses testing for proportions
\item Elucidate Type I and Type II errors
\item Articulate the conclusions to a broader audience. 

\end{itemize}
 }}

\section{Example 1}

\subsection{Is your colleague Cheating?}

Situation: During a lunch break, a colleague wants to play a game where you each flip a coin six times.  If the result of the flip heads, you win, if the result of the flip is tails your colleague wins.  Suppose the outcome of six plays of the game is T, T, T, T, T, T.  Did your colleague cheat?

Method: Deciding whether your colleague cheated, we need to determine the chance of getting six tails in a row. Let's assume that we are playing with a fair coin so that $P[tail] = P[Head] = 0.5$ so that each flip is independent.  Next, we should ask, ``is it unusual to have six tails in a row with a fair coin?''

Solution: We need to find the probability of achieving six tails in a row, assuming independence and fairness.

\begin{eqnarray*}
P[\texttt{six tails in a row}] &=& P[\texttt{ T and T and T and T and T and T} ] \\
&=& P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \\
&=& 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \\
&=& (0.5)^6 \\
&=& 0.0156
\end{eqnarray*}

If we flipped a \textit{fair} coin six times, 100 different times, we expect between 1 and 2 of the 100 experiments to result in all tails where each experiment consists of six flips of the coin.  So what we observed it is possible but highly unlikely.  Therefore, we can make one of two conclusions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Your colleague is not cheating and very lucky.
\item Your colleague did not use a \textit{fair} coin and cheated.
\end{enumerate}

Is your colleague cheating, or did we see an unusual event?

Here, we use \textit{hypothesis testing}.  We assume reality (in this case, the $P[tail] = 0.5$).  We gather data (sample) to determine whether the data contradicts our assumption.

\subsection{Define Hypotheses Testing}

Definition: Hypotheses testing is a process of using sample data and probability to test the characteristics of one or more populations.  For example, is there a difference in the birth weights between boys and girls.

Here is how we use hypotheses testings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a statement about the nature of the population(s).
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations.
  \item Select a test method.
  \end{itemize}

\item Analyze the data.
\item Interpret the Results.
\item Communicate our results to the audience.
\end{enumerate}

Definition: The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) is a statement about the status quo.  For example,  the proportion of (boys and girls) births are equal.

Definition: The Alternate Hypothesis ($H_a$) is a statement that we are trying to contradict the $H_0$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
  H_0: P_1 &=& P_2 \\
  H_a: P_1 &\ne& P_2 
\end{eqnarray*}  

\section{Testing Hypotheses } Two Proportions from Independent Samples.

When the difference, between the observed proportions of sample A and sample B, is similar; we can expect no significance, i.e., ($\hat{p}_a - \hat{p}_b) \sim 0$.  On the other hand, when the proportion is dissimilar, we should expect a significant difference.  We will examine this process shortly.

\end{table}

In this study, the researchers are testing the proportion between non-smokers and smoker.  They believe that the ratio of non-smokers between and smokers are different when drinking hard liquor.  So they set-up an experiment to test the hypotheses at $\alpha = 0.05$.  We should be thinking about the two-tailed test.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the difference between the proportions of smokers and non-smokers when consuming hard liquor, then we might assume that the proportion of smokers also consume hard liquor.    
\item Smoking is an independent variable.
\end{itemize}

Now we can consider the above model to solve the situation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item State the hypotheses

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $H_0: P_1 = P_2$,   where $P_1$ is the proportion who smoke.
  \item $H_a: P_1 \ne P_2$, where $P_2$ is the proportion who do not smoke.
  \end{itemize}
  
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan. 

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations. ($T_1 = 74$ smokers and $T_2 = 38$ non-smokers)
  \item Compute the standard error of the difference between the two proportions:
  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} &=& \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2} \\
             &=& \sqrt{ \frac{\frac{N_1}{T_1} *(1 - \frac{N_1}{T_1})}{T_1} + \frac{\frac{N_2}{T_2} *(1 - \frac{N_2}{T_2})}{T_2} }
  \end{eqnarray*}
    
  \item Calculate the test statitic:
  
    \begin{equation*}
    z_0 = \frac{\frac{N_1}{T_1} - \frac{N_2}{T_2}}{SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2}}
    \end{equation*}

  \end{enumerate}  


\item Make a statement about the nature of the population(s).
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations.
  \item Select a test method.
  \end{itemize}

\item Analyze the data.
\item Interpret the Results.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a relationship between drinkers of hard liquor and smokers, then we would assume that more students who never smoked are also non-drinkers of hard liquor. Also, those who drink hard liquor are likely to be smokers.
\item In other words, The proportion of drinkers of hard liquor who smoke is going to be different from the proportion of drinkers of hard liquor who do not smoke.
\item Note: non-smoking (ns) and smoking (s) are the two independent variables.
\end{itemize}

Now let's consider the five-step model introduced above.

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1. Read the problem carefully.
\item Step 2. Stating the Hypotheses 

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: P_s & = & P_{ns} \\
H_a: P_s & \ne & P_{ns} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Step 3.  Deciding the Sampling Distribution and Set up the Critical Region.



\begin{tabular}{@{} rcl @{}}
Sampling Distribution & = & Approximately Normal \\
Alpha ($\alpha$)  & = & 0.05 \\
Critic Value (CV) & = & 1.959964 
\end{tabular}

\item Step 4.  Computing the Standard Error.

\begin{eqnarray*}
    SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} &=& \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2} \\
             &=& \sqrt{ \frac{\frac{56}{74} *(1 - \frac{56}{74})}{74} + \frac{\frac{15}{38} *(1 - \frac{15}{38})}{38} } \\ \vspace{3mm}
             &=& 0.0936743
  \end{eqnarray*}
    
  \item Calculate the test statitic:
  
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    z_0 &=& \frac{\frac{56}{74} - \frac{15}{38}}{0.0936743} \\ \vspace{3mm}
        &=& 3.8646667
    \end{eqnarray*}

\item Step 5.  Producing a Decision and Interpreting the Results of the Test.
	\begin{itemize}
	\samepage
	\item Since the test statistic (3.8646667) is greater than CV (1.959964), therefore, reject the null hypothesis ($H_0: P_s = P_{ns}$).
	\samepage
	\item The interpretation is that there is evidence that the proportion of smokers is different from the proporton of non-smoker when drinking hard liquor.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example 2}    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have classified a random sample of 100 social work majors regarding whether the Council on Social Work Education has accredited their undergraduate programs (the \emph{independent variable}) and whether they are working in social work positions within three months of graduation (the \emph{dependent variable}).

From Table 1.2, Can we conclude from these data at a 5 percent level of significance that the proportion of persons working as a Social Worker who graduated from an accedited program is equal the proportion of persons working as a Social Worker who graduated from a non-accedited program?

Now let's consider the five-step model presented above.

\section{Types of Errors}

A \textbf{type I error} is rejecting a \textbf{true null hypothesis}.  This error is a false positive.   We commit a type I error when we reject a relationship when it is true.  An example of a Type I error is rejecting the statement MMR vaccine is effective against mumps.

A \textbf{type II error} is failing to reject a \textbf{false null hypothesis}.  This error is a false negative.  We commit a type II error when we fail to reject a relationship when it is false.  An example of a Type II error is a blood test designed to detect clots in patients who have a clot and does not detect it.

When comparing two proportions, concluding the proportions were different when in reality they were not different would be a type I error; concluding the proportions were not different when in reality they were different would be a type II error. 

The following table summarizes the above definitions.

 A local city has \\ outsourced some of its planning function.  \\ The contractor has built a database that describes the neighborhoods in the city and has developed a model so that we rate each area for their ``quality of life'' such as noise, open spaces, walkable areas, etc.  She has surveyed a random sample of these districts about \\ their level of satisfaction with their neighborhoods.   Do the results of the study agree with the contractor's objective ratings of quality with the respondents' self-reports of appreciation?

Subjects in group 1 received Drug Z, while subjects in group 2 received a control vaccine.  After the first \\ dose, 170 of 701 subjects in the experimental group (group 1) experienced fever as a side effect.

\chapter{Sampling Distribution of the Mean}
\label{chap:ch11}

\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

\begin{itemize}
\item Define and explain the behavioral properties of the sample average
\item Estimate the population mean
\item Calculate and interpret confidence interval of the population mean
\item Determine the sample size for estimating the population mean

}}

\section{Behavioral Properties of the Sample Average}

What percentage of adult men are between 5'6'' and 6' tall?  Population surveys have shown that men's heights are approximately normally distributed with mean 5'9'' and SD 3''.  Thus, the percentage of men between 5'6'' and 6' is estimated as 68\%, the percentage within 1 SD of the mean.  See Figure 10.1 below.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{The Percentage of Men's Heights between 66 and 72 inches}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=10cm,height=6cm]{figure/LBL10-1} 

}




\end{figure}

If the population of men is randomly assigned into groups of 9, and the average heights are computed for each group, what percentage of groups average between 5'6'' and 6' in height?    Is the answer approximately 68\%?  No.  In fact, more than 99\% of the groups will average between 5'6'' and 6', even though only 68\% of individuals do.  Why?  Because averages tend to include tall, short and medium heights -- therefore averages tend to fall closer to the middle than individuals.   (Think about this:  We put in a hat the names of all the men in the class.  We will win \$20 if the names we draw average over 6 feet tall.  Would we instead draw 1 or 2 names?  What are our chances of winning if we draw nine names?)  

The following is a small simulation study of the behavior of the sample mean.  Fifty samples are drawn (each containing $n = 9$ individuals) from a population with mean 69 inches and SD 3 inches.  For each sample, we calculate the average.  Observe that none of the samples average over 71 inches, even though many individuals do.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Heights of 50 samples of Nine Men}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccccccccc @{}} \hline
Sample & (1)&(2)&(3)&(4)&(5)&(6)&(7)&(8)&(9)& Ave \\ \hline

$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ \\ \hline
SD: &3.17&2.56&2.66&3.25&2.94&2.56&3.10&3.33&3.62 & 0.92 \\
Mean: &68.53&68.18&68.92&68.51&69.26&68.72&68.66&68.86&68.11& 68.64 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first lesson of this chapter says:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{Averages are less variable than individuals}}

Do we see this in the simulation study?  To make it easier to see, look at the SD of each column.  The SD of individuals tend to be around 3.0 (the actual value), but the SD of averages is much smaller.  How much smaller?  We now state the central lesson of the chapter.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{SD of $\bar{X} = \frac{\texttt{SD of individuals}}{\sqrt{n} }$ }}

Since the individuals in the simulation study have SD of 3 inches, the SD of 9-member averages is:

\begin{equation*}
\bar{X}_{n=9} = \frac{\texttt{SD of individuals}}{\sqrt{n} } = \frac{3}{\sqrt{9}} = 1.0 
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the real value for the SD of the last column is 1.0.  The simulated SD is 0.92, which is close.

\subsubsection{Example 1}

Suppose that men's heights are normally distributed with a mean 5'9'' and a SD 3''.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What percentage of men are over 5'11'' tall?
  \item Select a man at random.  What is the probability that he is over 5'11'' tall?
  \item If we calculate the average height for all possible samples of size nine that we can take, what percentage of averages will exceed 5'11''?
  \item Given one randomly selected sample of size 9, what is the probability that the average height will exceed 5'11''?
  \item Given a sample of size 25, what is the probability that the average height will exceed 5'11''?
  \item Given a sample of size nine, the average height of the sample will exceed \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}} with probability 0.90
  \item 90\% of samples of size nine will have an average height exceeding \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}}.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Estimating the Population Mean}

Consider estimating the average GPA (call this $\mu$) of the approximately 23,000 WMU undergraduates.  In the absence of the complete database, we may wish to estimate $\mu$ by taking a random sample of, say, $n = 25$ students and computing the sample average (call this $\bar{X}$).  Suppose $\bar{X} = 3.05$.  Now, unless we got fortunate with the random sample, chances are the 3.05 estimate missed the true value $\mu$.  By how much?

On the average, a random variable misses its expected value by one standard deviation.  We expect $\bar{X}$ to miss by how much?  one SD of $\bar{X}$.  Using the equation above, we can estimate this by $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$, since the sample standard deviation $s$ estimates the SD of individuals.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The population mean ($\mu$) is estimated using the sample mean ($\bar{X}$).  The estimate tends to miss the $\mu$ by an amount called the \textit{standard error (SE)} of the mean which is calculated as $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$:
$$ SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$
}}

Returning to the GPA example, suppose that the sample of $n = 25$ students yielded an average GPA of 3.05 and a standard deviation of 0.40.  Then the WMU population average GPA is estimated as 3.05 with a standard error of $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.40}{\sqrt{25}} = 0.08$.

\subsubsection{Example 2}

What is the average length of stay for undergraduate students at WMU?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose 25 graduating students were randomly selected and asked about their length of stay.  Suppose that the sample averaged 5.3 years, with an SD of 1.5 years.  Then the WMU average stay is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}}  years give or take \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}} years or so. 

  \item A second sample of 100 students were interviewed.   The mean and SD for the second sample were also 5.3 years and 1.5 years, respectively. Calculate an estimate for the WMU average stay and provide a standard error for your estimate.
\end{enumerate}

Similar to the SE for proportions, the formula for the SE of the mean has the sample size (i) in the denominator, and (ii) inside the square root sign.  Therefore, increasing the sample size by a factor of 4 makes the standard error decrease by a factor of $\sqrt{4}$. 

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The standard error (SE) of the mean decreases like the square root of the sample size (n).
}}

\section{Estimating the Population Mean Using Intervals}

Variables tend to miss their expected value, but should be within 1 SD 68\% of the time, and within 1.96 SD's 95\% of the time. Changing notation for SD to SE, we get

\begin{equation*}
| \bar{X} - \mu | \le 1.96 (SE) 
\end{equation*}

95\% of the time, where SE is given by the equation in section 10.3.  As a consequence,

\begin{equation*}
\texttt{Population mean, } \mu \texttt{ is inside the interval } \bar{X} \pm 1.96 (SE) 
\end{equation*}

95\% of the time.  This method gives an interval estimate of $\mu$. 

\vspace{2mm}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\textbf{95\% Confidence Interval for $\mu$} \\
A 95\% Confidence Interval estimate for the population mean $\mu$ is given by 

\begin{equation*}
 \bar{X} \pm 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation*}
}}

\vspace{2mm}

The term $1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is called the 95\% margin of error.

\section{Sample Size for Estimating the Population Mean}

If we wanted to reduce the margin of error to some value $ME$, then we set the formula for margin of error equal to $ME$, i.e., $ME = 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$.  Solving for $n$ gives the result we need.  

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
In order to be 95\% confident that the sample mean is within a distance $ME$ of the true population $\mu$, choose a sample size equal to 
\begin{equation*}
 n = \frac{1.96^2 s^2}{ME^2}
\end{equation*}
where $s$ is the standard deviation based on historical data or a pilot sample.  The quantity $ME$ is called the 95\% margin of error for $\mu$.

\chapter{Comparing Two Means}

\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare two population averages when the samples are independent using confidence intervals.
\item Compare two population averages when the data are dependent (paired) \\ using confidence intervals.

\section{Estimating the Difference between Independent Means}  \index{comparing two means}

Suppose we sample two means $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$  from two populations with unknown means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. Think of it as a picture:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{chapters/Chapter_12/ext_figure/x1.png} % requires the graphicx package
\includegraphics[width=4.3cm]{chapters/Chapter_12/ext_figure/x2.png} % requires the graphicx package
\end{figure}

As you can see, the sample circles including $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ are smaller than the entire population circles including $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. In other words, we do not have all the information we need to be sure about the exact values of  $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. However, as we have learned, statistics allows for sample means to estimate population means as depicted by the arrows. What's new in this chapter is that here we learn statistics can do more than allow us to estimate values for $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ separately. We can also use statistics to investigate how the population means differ from one another in tandem. We do this by performing \textit{hypothesis tests} on and using confidence intervals centered around the difference between the sample means $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$. Let's now turn to some formulaic examples of such tests and intervals.

Is there ``grade inflation'' in WMU?  How does the average GPA of WMU students today compare with, say ten years ago?  Suppose a random sample of 100 student records from 10 years ago yields an average sample GPA of 2.90 with a standard deviation of 0.40.  A random sample of 100 current students today yields a sample average of 2.98 with a standard deviation of 0.45.  The difference between the two-sample means is $2.98 - 2.90 = 0.08$.  Is this proof that GPA's are higher today than ten years ago?  Well $\dots$ first, we need to account for the fact that 2.98 and 2.90 are not the correct averages but that we compute the average from random samples.  Therefore, 0.08 is not the exact difference, but merely an estimate of the actual difference. By how much will it miss?

Note that we took differences $2.98 - 2.90$ to compare average GPA.  The two averages 2.98 and 2.90 are independent, in the sense that we base them on separate and independent groups of students.  The SE of the difference is

\begin{equation}
SE_{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)} = \sqrt{SE_{\bar{x}_1}^2 + SE_{\bar{x}_2}^2 }
\end{equation}

whenever the two means are independent.  Equation (12.1) is similar to the equation from chapter 9, the $SE_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{(SE_{\hat{p}_1^2} + SE_{\hat{p}_2^2 })}$, for proportions. 

Now, applying the equation from chapter 10, $SE_{\bar{X}}$ which is calculated as $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ twice, we get

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The standard error of the difference between two independent means.

\begin{equation}
SE_{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)} = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}  + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} }
\end{equation}
}}

Continuing with the example, let $\bar{X}_1  = 2.98$ and $\bar{X}_2  = 2.90$.  Then the sample standard deviations are $s_1 = 0.45$ and $s_2 = 0.40$.   The sample sizes are $n_1 = 100$ and $n_2 = 100$.

\begin{equation*}
SE_{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)} = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}  + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } = \sqrt{\frac{0.45^2}{100}  + \frac{0.40^2}{100} } = 0.06
\end{equation*}

Therefore, we can state the conclusion of the study as follows: ``The average GPA of WMU students today is .08 higher than 10 years ago, give or take .06 or so.'' We also could have used equation (12.1) instead of (12.2) in calculating the standard error:

\begin{eqnarray*}
SE_{\bar{X}_1} &=& \frac{s_1}{\sqrt{n_1}} = \frac{0.45}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.045 \\
SE_{\bar{X}_2} &=& \frac{s_2}{\sqrt{n_2}} = \frac{0.40}{\sqrt{100}} = 0.040 \\
SE_{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2} &=& \sqrt{0.045^2 + 0.040^2} = 0.06 
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection{Using a confidence interval}

The following two sections discuss the formulas and concepts necessary for calculation and interpretation (respectively) of confidence intervals on the difference between two independent means. Let’s start with the concepts and then proceed to some formulas and examples.

\subsubsection{Confidence Interval - Concepts:}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=9cm]{chapters/Chapter_12/ext_figure/2sample.png} % requires the graphicx package
\end{figure}

The interval between lower and upper bounds (LB, UB) includes some possible values of $\mu_1 - \mu_2$  (depicted by the many arrows). We need an interval around the central estimate $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ because of variation between samples and populations (which was depicted using concentric circles at the start of this chapter). This interval can be thought of as the ``wiggle room'' needed to estimate $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ using only $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$.

Here we show how to use this interval, and it is necessary to talk about some basic properties of a difference first.  For any two numbers A and B, there are three possibilities when evaluating their difference:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $A - B$ is a positive number, then A is greater than B. Consider the numbers 4 and 3. If we take $4 - 3 = 1$, the answer is greater than zero.

  \item If $A - B$ is a negative number, then B is higher than A.  For instance if we take  $3 - 4 = -1$, the answer is negative.

  \item If $A - B$ is 0, then A = B. Consider the numbers 4 and 4: $4 - 4 = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

The same kind of reasoning holds for all the possible values of $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ between LB and UB depicted above:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If all the values from LB to UB are positive, then 
  $\mu_1$ is significantly greater than $\mu_2$.

  \item If all the values from LB to UB are negative, then $\mu_1$ is significantly less than $\mu_2$. 

  \item If zero is between LB and UB (inclusive), then $\mu_1$ is not significantly different from $\mu_2$.
\end{enumerate}

Note that this is to say that the same reasoning and terminology outlined in the section on statistical significance in chapter 9 apply in the new case of a difference.  If the confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ does not contain 0, then 0 has been effectively excluded from the range of possible values.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
When the confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ does not contain \textbf{zero}, we say that the difference is statistically \textbf{significant}.
}}

\subsubsection{Confidence Interval - Calculations and Examples:}

The difference of two means is a random variable with expected value and spread.  The 68\% and 95\% rules apply, i.e. the estimated difference of $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ should be within 1 SE of the true value 68\% of the time, and within 1.96 SE's 95\% of the time.  Following the usual reasoning,    

\begin{equation*}
(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) \pm 1.96 SE_{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)}
\end{equation*}

should contain the true difference $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$ with 95\% confidence.  Substituting (12.2), we get the following formula.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
95\% confidence interval for $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$:

\begin{equation}
  (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
\end{equation}
}}

For grade inflation, we have

\begin{equation*}
  (2.98 - 2.90) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{0.45^2}{100} + \frac{0.40^2}{100}}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  0.08 \pm 1.96 (0.06)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
  (-0.04, 0.20)
\end{equation*}

We say that the difference in GPA averages is between $-.04$ and $.20$ with 95\% confidence.  Note that 0 has not been excluded, making simple chance variability a viable explanation for the observed difference. 

\subsection{Statistical Significance}

Let us revisit the diet study mentioned earlier.  The following table contains the mean changes in body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) for the Atkins, Zone and Ornish diets. Now, compare the Atkins and Zone diets at 12 months:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Mean Changes (SD) in Body Mass Index by Diet Group \& Time}
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
Time (months) & Atkins $(n = 77)$ & Zone $(n = 79)$ & Ornish $(n = 76)$ \\ \hline
2 & -1.60(0.98) & -0.76(0.99) & -0.95(0.90) \\
6 & -2.16(2.14) & -0.73(0.90) & -0.85(1.60) \\
12 & -1.65(2.54) & -0.53(2.00) & -0.77(2.14) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

On the average, Atkins lost how much more body mass index points than Zone?  The estimate of $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$ is

\begin{equation*}
  (\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2) = (-0.53) - (-1.65) = 1.12
\end{equation*}

The standard error is 

\begin{equation*}
  SE_{(\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2)} = \sqrt{ \frac{(2.00)^2}{79} + \frac{(2.54)^2}{77}} = 0.367
\end{equation*}

The 95\% confidence interval for $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$ is

\begin{equation*}
  1.12 \pm 1.96 (0.367)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
(0.84, 1.84)
\end{equation*}

Thus, even allowing for 1.96 SE's of chance variability, Atkins lost at least .40 more body mass index points than Zone (and could be as large as 1.84).   When the confidence interval for $(\mu_1 - \mu_2)$  does not contain zero, we say that the difference is statistically significant.  

\subsection{The P-value}

Continuing the example of the previous section, we might ask ``Can't the difference in averages $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 = 1.12$ be explained by chance variability, rather than diet effect?''

The answer is ``Yes, 1.12 can occur by chance, but with very tiny probability.''  How small? Well, if the actual difference were 0, and the SE is 0.367, then the value 1.12 is

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1.12}{0.367} = 3.05
\end{equation*}

SE's from the expected value using the normal curve, random variables fall as far as 3.05 or more SE's from the expected value with approximately 0.0022 probability.  Since this number (also called the $P$-value) is quite small, it makes it hard to believe that the actual difference is zero.  Hence, we conclude that statistically, the two means are different.  Alternatively, we can say that the means are \textit{significantly} different.


\section{Paired data (before-and-after)}

In this section, we will discuss a common problem in data analysis: comparing before and after measurements.  Consider the possible weight loss data in Table 12.2.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Weight in pounds before and after after 12 months on diet}
\begin{tabular}{@{} crr @{}} \hline
Subject & Before & After \\ \hline
1 & 180 & 155 \\
2 & 192 & 187 \\
3 & 205 & 194 \\
4 & 166 & 176 \\
5 & 220 & 205 \\
6 & 177 & 172 \\
7 & 189 & 173 \\ \hline
Ave: & 189.9 & 180.3 \\
SD:  & 18.1 & 16.4 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Using the notation of the previous section estimating the difference between independent means, we have

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

$\bar{X}_1 = 189.9$ \\
$s_1 = 18.1$ \\
$n_1 = 7$ 
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{3cm}

$\bar{X}_2 = 180.3$ \\
$s_2 = 16.4$ \\
$n_2 = 7$ 
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

What is the estimate of mean weight change after 12 months?  $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 = 9.6$ pounds, right?  What is the standard error of this estimate? Using equation (12.2) 

\begin{equation*}
SE_{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)} = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}  + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } = \sqrt{\frac{(18.1)^2}{7}  + \frac{(16.4)^2}{7} } = 9.2 \texttt{ pounds}
\end{equation*}

right?  \textbf{wrong!}

We should not use equations (12.1) or (12.2) because the two means are \textbf{not} independent, i.e., they are not calculated on independent samples. The use of the plural `samples' is in itself wrong because we do not have two samples, we only have one! We need to watch out for this.  How many samples are there?  Before-and-after data generally consist of only one sample of subjects, each measured twice.

So how do we calculate an estimate and standard error of average weight loss?  
By calculating the amount of change from Before to After.  The computed value amounts to taking differences, as shown in Table 12.3.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Weight in pounds before and after after 12 months on diet}
\begin{tabular}{@{} crrr @{}} \hline
Subject & Before & After & Difference \\ \hline
1 & 180 & 155 & 25 \\
2 & 192 & 187 & 5 \\
3 & 205 & 194 & 11 \\
4 & 166 & 176 & -10 \\
5 & 220 & 205 & 15 \\
6 & 177 & 172 & 5 \\
7 & 189 & 173 & 16 \\ \hline
Ave: &  &  & 9.6 \\
SD:  &  & & 11.1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Compare Table 12.3 to Table 12.2.  We have reduced the summary statistics to a single sample, appropriately.  The relevant statistics are now:

$$ \bar{X} = 9.6,  s = 11.1,  n= 7 $$

What does the sample mean $\bar{X} = 9.6$ estimate?  It estimates the average change, right?  To be specific, it estimates the average weight loss from Month 0 to Month 12.  What is the standard error of the estimate?  Since it is just another average, the appropriate procedure is given by 

\begin{equation*}
SE_{\bar{X}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{11.1}{\sqrt{7}} = 4.2 \texttt{ pounds}
\end{equation*}

Completing the analysis, the 95\% confidence interval for average change is

\begin{equation*}
9.6 \pm 1.96 (4.2)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
(1.4, 17.8)
\end{equation*}

Since the interval does not contain zero, the average weight change is statistically significant.

\subsection{Paired Data}

Paired data are data in which natural matchings occur.  For example, when researchers collect two measurements (one before treatment and one after treatment) from a subject, then we have paired data, and the analysis should follow as described above.  

For example, we might want to compare the head injury of drivers versus passengers in car crashes.   In a study, automobiles were crashed into a wall at a speed of 35 MPH with dummies in the driver and front passenger seat. The head injury criterion (HIC) was measured.  Following is a selection of cars and their HIC values.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} lll @{}} \hline
Company & Driver & Passenger \\ \hline
Acura Integra 87        &     		599   &      597 \\
Audi 80 89              &    		600    &     515 \\
Chevrolet Camaro 91     &    		585    &     583 \\
Ford Escort 87          &     		551   &      418 \\
Honda Accord LX 91      &     	562     &    539 \\
Toyota Corolla Fx 88    &    		593     &    397 \\
Volvo 740 GLE 88        &      		519   &      445 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Since we uniquely match each pair of observations (e.g., 599 and 597) to each other (driver and passenger HIC in the same car and crash), this is paired data and deserves paired data analysis.

Ramp metering is an engineering experiment that studies how automobiles enter an expressway to stop for a \\ short time before they join the flow of traffic.  The theory is that ramp metering  directs the number of vehicles on the expressway and the  number of vehicles accessing the expressway, resulting in a freer flow, which results in a faster travel times.  To prove the hypothesis whether ramp metering affects travel time, traffic engineers in Kalamazoo, Michigan, set up an experiment on a section of expressway where ramp meters were installed.  The response variable was the speed of vehicles.  A random sample of 15 vehicles on the expressway for a Tuesday at 5 p.m. with the ramp meters on and a second random sample of 15 vehicles on a different Tuesday at 5 p.m. with the ramp meters off resulted in the following speed summaries(in miles per hour).

\chapter{More Comparing Two Means}
\label{chap:ch13}

\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Set-up and perform hypothesis testing for means
\item Explain Type I and Type II errors
\item Articulate the conclusions to a broader audience.
\end{itemize}
}}

\section{Overview and Example 1}

\subsection{Grade Inflation Revisited}

The previous chapter outlines a situation where some grade inflation might occur at WMU over the last ten years.  The method used to analyze this situation was a confidence interval.  Instead of a confidence interval, let us return to that example, and try a different form of analysis:  the hypothesis test using test statistic, and $p$-value.  The new method will have the same result as the confidence interval.  However, we must learn both methods since many disciplines use both statistical analyses.  Let us review the relevant statistics.

Suppose a random sample of 100 student records from 10 years ago yields an average sample GPA of 2.90 with a standard deviation of 0.40. A random sample of 100 current students today yields a sample average of 2.98 with a standard deviation of 0.45. The difference between the two-sample means is $2.98 - 2.90 = 0.08$.  We will use the following  notation: $n_1 = 100$, $\bar{x}_1 = 2.90$, $s_1 = 0.40$, $n_2 = 100$, $\bar{x}_2 = 2.98$, and $s_2 = 0.45$.

% \newpage

What are the two possibilities here?


\begin{enumerate}
\item There is no grade inflation at WMU, our sample is in error.
\item There is grade inflation at WMU, our sample is not in error.
\end{enumerate}


Although we cannot say for sure which of the possibilities is true, we can calculate the probability of each possibility. To do so, we will (as always) assume the normal distribution holds, assume the two means are independent, calculate a standard error, calculate a test statistic, and find a $p$-value.

\subsection{Define Hypotheses Testing}

Definition: Hypotheses testing is a process of using sample data and probability to test the characteristics of one or more populations. In the present example, the populations are all the students at WMU during the first sampling, and all students at WMU during the second sampling.

Here is how we use hypotheses tests:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a statement about the nature of the population(s). 
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal 
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations.
  \item Select a test method.
  \end{itemize}
\item Analyze the data.
\item Interpret the Results.
\item Communicate our results to the audience.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Definition:} The Null Hypothesis $(H_0)$ is a statement about the status quo. It says there is no difference.

\subsubsection{Definition:} The Alternative Hypothesis $(H_a)$ is a statement that contradicts the $(H_0)$. It says there is a difference.

If the null hypothesis is true, then in a sense nothing special is going on. In the present example, the null hypothesis is that there is no grade inflation at WMU. Can we reject this null hypothesis and state that it is probably the case that there is grade inflation at WMU? If so, then we would be affirming the alternative hypothesis We will find out soon. For now let us write that:

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \\
H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2 
\end{eqnarray*}

The greek letter $\mu$ is a common symbol for a population mean. This is convenient notation that really says the same thing as the above text: the null hypothesis is that the two population means are equal, or that there is no difference between WMU grades at time 1 and time 2; the alternative hypothesis is that the two population means are not equal, or that there is a difference between WMU grades at time 1 and time 2. Often in the real world of statistical analyses, the statement of the alternative hypothesis is a little more difficult. An alternative hypothesis could be $<$, $>$, or $\ne$, i.e., it could be either one or two-tailed, but in our course we keep things simple for you and simply always use $\ne$.

\section{Calculation and Analysis for Example 1}

When the difference, between the observed means of sample A and sample B, is similar; we can expect no significance, i.e., $(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \sim 0 $.   On the other hand, when the means are
dissimilar, we should expect a significant difference. The bigger the difference, the more likely we are to find significance and conclude with the alternative hypothesis. Recalling that our difference in the grade inflation example is $(2.98 - 2.90) = 0.08$, we might expect there really is not a significant difference here, but let us perform the full analysis to find out.

\begin{enumerate}
\item State the hypotheses
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ ,  there is no grade inflation. 
  \item $H_a: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ ,  there is  grade inflation. 
  \end{itemize}
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We assume the sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05 (this could be any value $\le 1$,  but again, we will keep things simple for this course and always select 0.05 or 95 percent confidence).
  \item Determine the number of observations: $n_1 = 100, n_2 = 100$. 
  \item Selecting a standard error based on the above assumptions:
  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2} &=& \sqrt{ SE_{\bar{x}_1} + SE_{\bar{x}_2}} \\
   &=& \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}
   \end{eqnarray*} 
 
\item Selecting a test method (statistic):

  \begin{eqnarray*}
  Z_0 &=& \frac{ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}} \\
  &=& \frac{ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{ \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} }
   \end{eqnarray*} 
 \end{enumerate}
 
\item Analyze the data. Let us calculate the above:

  \begin{eqnarray*}
  Z_0 &=& \frac{ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{ \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} } \\
    &=& \frac{ 2.98 - 2.90 }{ \sqrt{ \frac{0.45^2 }{100} + \frac{0.40^2}{100}}} \\
    &=& \frac{ 0.08}{0.06} \\
    &\approx& 1.3333 
   \end{eqnarray*} 
   
\item Interpret the Results.

\begin{itemize}
\item The test statistic is relatively small at $Z_0 = 1.3333$.  Recall that we decided on a significance level $(\alpha)$ of 0.05. This level of significance implies we’d need at least $|Z| = 1.96$ to conclude there is a significant change between the two sampling times.

\item We cannot conclude a significant difference, so we do not reject the null hypothesis. Our sample does not show there is significant grade inflation at WMU.

\item Note: We have to be careful here. This is not quite the same as saying there is no grade inflation at WMU. Instead, we say that it’s not likely there is grade inflation given our sample data. We just don’t have enough evidence for the alternative hypothesis that there is grade inflation.

\item Could we have used the $p$-value instead to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis? Yes. The $p$-value of these two-tailed tests is the probability of obtaining an $|Z|$ value larger than that of the test statistic.  In notation: 
$p$-value $ = P[ |Z| > |Z_0|$].  This probability can be obtained from the $Z$-table by finding the area of the curve less than a negative $Z_0$ or greater than a positive $Z_0$, then multiplying this area by 2. In our example, the probability obtained from the $Z$-table using $Z_0 = 1.33$ is 0.0918.  $p$-value $= 2 \times 0.0918 = 0.1836$. Recall now that our significance level was set at 0.05 at the outset of this problem.  We use the decision rule that the $p$-value must be less or equal to the significance level in order to reject the null hypothesis. 
Since our $p$-value 0.1836 is much greater than 0.05, therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis (as we expected). Once again we conclude there is not enough evidence to decide there is grade inflation at WMU, whether using the test statistic, the $p$-value, or the previous chapter confidence interval.

\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Example 2}

\subsection{The Question}

In their paper \textit{Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties,} \footnote{ P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos and J. Reis. Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.  In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.}
Cortez et al. present a dataset on wine qualities and preferences. Many interesting variables
are included such as the pH, fixed acidity, alcohol content, and quality score for thousands of 
sampled wines. For the remainder of this chapter, we will use this dataset to compare means 


So what questions can we ask about the wines using this dataset? There are many interesting topics to choose from since the dataset contains 13 variables across 6497 different sampled wines. Let’s start with grouping by color and go from there; the dataset contains 1599 red wines and 4898 white wines. Do you think there may be a difference in the fixed acidity of red vs. white wines? Let’s find out.

\subsubsection{The Question:}  Do the averages of fixed acidity for white vs. red wines significantly differ?

\subsection{Working Through Example 2}



\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a statement about the nature of the population(s).

We did this above. Let’s note here that the two populations, red vs. white wines, are independent of one another as required by the mathematics taught here.

\item Formulate an Analysis Plan.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal \\ Are the samples roughly normal? Let’s check by constructing histograms:
  
\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=6cm,height=6cm]{figure/LBL13ab-1} 

}




\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=6cm,height=6cm]{figure/LBL13ac-1} 

}



\end{minipage}


Although a little right skewed, we can treat these as normal for our purposes. It is always a good idea to check the data before proceeding. We also know the samples are separate.

  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.

  Recall this implies that we'll use a benchmark $|Z| = 1.96$ to draw our conclusions at the end.
  
  \item Determine the number of observations.
  
  As noted above, there are 6497 different sampled wines in this dataset. 1599 are
red, and 4898 are white.

  \item Select a test method.
  
  We'll use the same $Z_0$ as before:
  
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    Z_0 &=& \frac{ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{SE_{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}} \\
      &=& \frac{ \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{ \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} }
   \end{eqnarray*} 

  \end{itemize}
  
\item Analyze the data.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $H_0: \mu_w = \mu_r$ ,    there is no difference in fixed acidity between red and white wines. 
  \item $H_a: \mu_w \ne \mu_r$ ,  there is a difference in fixed acidity between red and white wines. 
  \end{itemize}
  
  We will use R software to calculate the necessary sample statistic:
 
 % Requires the booktabs if the memoir class is not being used
\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \caption{Summary Statistics}
   %\topcaption{Table captions are better up top} % requires the topcapt package
   \begin{tabular}{@{} lrr @{}}  \hline % Column formatting, @{} suppresses leading/trailing space
      % \toprule
      & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Wines } \\
      \hline 
      % \cmidrule(r){1-2} % Partial rule. (r) trims the line a little bit on the right; (l) & (lr) also possible
          & White(w)  & Red(r)  \\ \hline
      % \midrule
      Mean & 6.8547877 & 8.3196373 \\
      SD   & 0.8438682 & 1.7410963 \\
      N    & 4898  & 1599  \\ \hline
   \end{tabular}
   
   \label{tab:tbwines}
\end{table} 

Finally we calculate the test statistic:

  \begin{eqnarray*}
  Z_0 &=& \frac{ \bar{x}_w - \bar{x}_r}{ \sqrt{ \frac{s_w^2}{n_w} + \frac{s_r^2}{n_r}}} \\
    &=& \frac{ 6.85 - 8.32 }{ \sqrt{ \frac{0.844^2 }{4898} + \frac{1.741^2}{1599}}} \\
    &\approx& -32.42 
   \end{eqnarray*} 
   
Note that this time we obtained a negative $Z_0$ because of the way we took the difference in the numerator. There is nothing wrong with this. We could have switched the numerator around and obtained its positive counterpart just as easily.

\item Interpret the Results.

This $Z_0 = -32.42$ is an extreme Z value.  It falls very far off the Z table.  This is much less than $Z = -1.96$, so we reject the null hypothesis with great force.  We might also consider the $p$-value. Although the $p$-value cannot be obtained from the Z-table since it does not go beyond -4, we can use R software to calculate it. The $p$-value is 1.43e-230, diminishingly smaller than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis. The fixed acidities are quite different given the large sample size. We are much more than 95 percent confident that white wine and red wine differ in their fixed acidities according to this analysis.

\item Communicate our results to the audience.

Many different options are available to you here such as the histograms, sample statistics, test statistic, and $p$-value.  Perhaps the most difficult point to make is the significance of our $Z_0$ since it is quite far from zero, and the $p$-value quite small. To help with this, we can say we are over 30 standard errors from no difference between these two means! We could also say that the $p$-value has over 200 zeros past the decimal!

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Large Samples, Free Data, and Free Software }

The wine dataset used above is freely available online and fun to play with. One reason it was selected for this chapter was to demonstrate the impact a larger sample can have on your analysis. As you saw above, a large sample tends to make even small differences appear extremely significant. Another reason it was selected was to demonstrate the computational power you can get out of the free R software used to do the calculations. The reader is highly encouraged to download both the dataset and R software to do some explorations of their own. Please do not hesitate to ask your instructor for help downloading or using R during your coursework with us.

% Ramp metering is an engineering experiment that studies how automobiles enter an expressway to stop for a short time before they join the flow of traffic.  The theory is that ramp metering  directs the number of vehicles on the expressway and the \\ number of vehicles accessing the expressway, resulting in a freer flow, which results in a faster travel times.  To prove the hypothesis whether ramp metering affects travel time, traffic engineers in Kalamazoo, Michigan, set up an experiment on a section of expressway where ramp meters were installed.  The response variable was the speed of vehicles.  A random sample of 15 vehicles on the expressway for a Tuesday at 5 p.m. with the ramp meters on and a second random sample of 15 vehicles on a different Tuesday at 5 p.m. with the ramp meters off resulted in the following speed summaries(in miles per hour).

\chapter{Categorical Variables: Association or Independence}
\label{chap:ch14}

\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute expected frequencies.
\item Understand the difference between association and independence.
\item Test for a statistical association.
\end{itemize}

}}

\section{Association versus independence in an r x c table}  \index{association}

Is there an association between gender and height?  Yes, males tend to be taller than females.  A more formal way of saying this is `height distribution for males tends to be different from females.'   Is there an association between shoe size and height?  Yes,  `height distribution for men who wear size 12 is different from those who wear size 8.'    Is there an association between GPA and height?  No, `height distribution tends to be the same for 3.0 students as well as 3.5 students.'

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
Two variables A and B are said to be \textbf{associated} if the distribution of B tends to change with the level of the A variable.  Otherwise, they are said to be \textbf{independent} variables. 
}}

Therefore, height is associated with gender and shoe size, but independent of GPA.  

If we are thinking, ``association and independence are the same,''  we are almost correct.  The difference is about design. In the test of independence, we collect observational units at random from a population, and the two categorical variables are observed for each unit. In the test of association, we collect the data by randomly sampling from each sub-group \textbf{separately}. (Say, 100 Democrat, 100 Republican, 100 Independent, and so on.) The null hypothesis is that each sub-group shares the same distribution of another categorical variable. (Say, ``chain smoker'', ``occasional smoker'', ``non-smoker''.)  The difference between these two tests is subtle yet important.

Now consider the following 3 by 4 table.  Researchers followed 189 students entering a business school program as part of attrition (i.e., drop out, transfer) study.  The students were cross-classified according to 4 categories of high school GPA $(2.0-2.5, 2.5-3.0, 3.0-3.5, 3.5-4.0)$ and three categories of attrition outcomes (`did not return for the 2nd year,' `returned for second but not for a 3rd year,' `returned for 3rd year').  Is there an association between HS GPA and college attrition?

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Retention versus HS GPA}
\begin{tabular}{@{} lcccc @{}} \hline
& \multicolumn{4}{c}{GPA} \\
Returned & $2.0-2.5$ & $2.5-3.0$ & $3.0-3.5$ & $3.5-4.0$ \\ \hline
No --2nd yr & 25 & 3 & 4 & 6 \\
No -- 3rd yr & 14 & 7 & 4 & 6 \\
Yes -- 3rd yr & 41 & 7 & 28 & 44 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To analyze whether attrition and GPA are independent, we will analyze whether attrition distribution remains the same regardless of GPA level.  Let us start by looking at the 1st column (worst HS grades) and 4th column (best HS grades).  Do the distributions look the same?   The answer seems to be `no' - a bigger proportion of the 1st column never returned for their second year.  In other words, the value `25' in the very first cell is too large, implying that 'poor grades seems to be associated with first-year attrition.'  If grades and attrition were independent, Table 14.1 should have looked more like Table 14.2.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Expected counts (if independent)}
\begin{tabular}{@{} lcccc @{}} \hline
& \multicolumn{4}{c}{GPA} \\
Returned & $2.0-2.5$ & $2.5-3.0$ & $3.0-3.5$ & $3.5-4.0$ \\ \hline
No --2nd yr & 16 & 3 & 7 & 11 \\
No -- 3rd yr & 13 & 3 & 6 & 9 \\
Yes -- 3rd yr & 51 & 11 & 23 & 36 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The table shows expected counts under independence.  Observe that the row and column totals of the two tables are the same

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Expected counts (if independent)}
\begin{tabular}{@{} lcccccc @{}} \hline
& \multicolumn{4}{c}{GPA} \\
Returned & $2.0-2.5$ & $2.5-3.0$ & $3.0-3.5$ & $3.5-4.0$ & Total & Percent \\ \hline
No -- 2nd yr &  &  &  &  & 38 & (20.1\%) \\
No -- 3rd yr &  &  &  &  & 31 & (16.4\%)\\
Yes -- 3rd yr &  &  &  &  & 120 & (63.5\%) \\ \hline
Total        & 80 & 17 & 36 & 56 & 189 & (100\%) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Furthermore, note that 20.1\% of the data is in the first row, 16.4\% in the second row, and 65.5\% in the third row.  If we apply the same percentage breakdown to each column, we get

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} llll @{}} \hline
$80 \times .201 = 16.08$ & $17 \times .201 = 3.42$ & $56 \times .201 = 7.24$ & $56 \times .201 = 11.26$  \\
$80 \times .164 = 13.12$ & $17 \times .164 = 2.79$ & $56 \times .164 = 5.90$ & $56 \times .164 = 9.18$  \\
$80 \times .635 = 50.80$ & $17 \times .635 = 10.80$ & $56 \times .635 = 22.86$ & $56 \times .635 = 35.56$  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Rounding off gives us the expected frequencies in Table 14.2.

\subsection{Testing for statistical association}

Statisticians will conclude `independence' if Tables 14.1 and 14.2 are close and conclude `association' if they are far from each other.    We measure closeness and fairness by subtraction and squaring, as follows:



\begin{equation*}
\chi^2 = \frac{(25-16.08)^2}{16.08} + \frac{(3-3.42)^2}{3.42} + \cdots + \frac{(44-35.56)^2}{35.56} = 23.42  
\end{equation*}

Note that if Tables 14.1 and 14.2 are the same, then the $\chi^2$ statistic (pronounced `chi-square') in (14.1) will be zero (0).  If the two tables are far apart, the $\chi^2$ statistic will be large.  Statisticians use the following rule. 

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{8cm}{
If the $\chi^2 > b$, then conclude statistic association
}}
\end{center}

Otherwise, conclude independence.  The number $b$ is called a critical value and depends on the dimensions of the table.  Let $r$ be the number of rows, and $c$ be the number of columns.  Let

\begin{equation*}
df = (r - 1) \times (c - 1)
\end{equation*}

\vspace{1cm}
be a parameter called the degrees of freedom.  Then $b$ is given by the following table:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} lllllllllll @{}} \hline
df & 1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10 \\
b  & 3.84&5.99&7.81&9.49&11.07&12.59&14.07&15.51&16.92&18.31 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In our example on grades and attrition, we have r=3 rows and c=4 columns, so that

\begin{equation*}
df = (3 - 1) \times (4 - 1) = 6
\end{equation*}

so, the line between statistical association and independence is drawn at b=12.59.  
Since $\chi^2 = 23.42$ from (14.1), then $\chi^2 > 12.59$.   We conclude that there is significant association between high school GPA and college attrition rate.

The following data appeared in the Wall Street Journal in 1984.  Advertisements were selected by an annual survey conducted by Video Board Tests, Inc., a New York ad-testing company, based on interviews with 20,000 adults who were asked to name the most outstanding TV commercial they had seen, noticed, and liked. We based the retained impressions on a survey of 4,000 adults, in which regular product users were asked to cite a commercial they had seen for that product category in the past week.  `TV Ad Budget' was the 1983 advertising budget in \$ millions.  `Impressions' is the estimated number of million impressions per week.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{@{} lrr | lrr @{}} \hline
& \multicolumn{4}{c}{TV Ad} \\

Cola-Cola & 40.1 & 78.6 & Shasta & 5.7 & 10.0\\

Levi's & 27.0 & 40.8 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 15.1 shows a scatterplot of Impressions Score (Y) versus Ad Spending (X). Note that the points seem to fall around a line sloped upwards loosely.  We say that there is a positive linear association or a linear relationship between spending and the number of impressions made.  

If the points fall around a straight line sloped downwards, we say that there is a negative association.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Plot of Impressions vs. Ad Budget}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=10cm,height=6cm]{figure/LBL15a-1} 

}



\end{figure}

Researchers often express the direction and the strength of association in a single number called the (Pearson) \textit{correlation coefficient}.  Typically denoted by $r$, the correlation coefficient $r$ is a number between $-1$ and $+1$, inclusive.  A value of $r = 0$ means that no linear association exists; the points either look like a random scatter or fall around a horizontal line.  A value of $r = +1$ indicates a perfectly linear relationship; all the points fall on a straight line sloped upwards.  If $r = -1$, all the points fall on a straight line sloped downwards. The correlation between TV Ad Budget and Impressions in the data above is $+0.65$.

Figure 15.2 shows various scatterplots with different correlations.  Although $0.5$ is halfway between $0$ and $1$, note that the plot corresponding to $r = 0.5$ barely shows a pattern of association.  In practice, plots can show correlations up to $0.3$ purely by accident (e.g., the correlation between GPA and, say, shoe size).  When correlation reaches $+1$ or $-1$, all points fall on a straight line.

\section{Computing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient}

The following numerical example shows how to calculate $r$.  We will break the calculations down into four steps.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the mean and SD of X and Y.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccc @{}} \hline
Sample & X & Y \\ \hline
1 & 1 & 3 \\
2 & 3 & 9 \\
3 & 4 & 7 \\
4 & 4 & 9 \\
5 & 5 & 15 \\
6 & 7 & 11 \\ \hline
Average & 4 & 9 \\
SD  & 2 & 4 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\item Calculate the Z-scores from equation (6.1) on page 70.  

$$ Z_x = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{s_x} = \frac{X - 4}{2} \texttt{ and } Z_y = \frac{Y - \bar{Y}}{s_y} = \frac{Y - 9}{4} $$

\item Multiply the Z-scores and add up.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccc @{}} \hline
$Z_x$ & $Z_y$ & $Z_x Z_y$ \\ \hline
-1.5 & -1.5 & 2.25 \\
-0.5 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0.5 & 1.5 & 0.75 \\
1.5 & 0.5 & 0.75 \\ \hline
Average &  & 3.75 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\item Finally, the correlation is the sum divided by ($n - 1$).

$$ r = \frac{3.75}{6 - 1} = 0.75 $$
\end{enumerate}

We summarize the whole process in the following formula. 

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{10cm}{
\textbf{The Correlation coefficient r:} 

\begin{equation}
r = \frac{ \sum Z_x Z_y }{n - 1} 
\end{equation}
}}
\end{center}

Consider the Ad Spending example at the start of this chapter.  Many of the (X, Y) points are simultaneously above average since companies that have higher than average Advertising Spending also have higher than average Impressions.  

Both $X - \bar{X}$  and $Y - \bar{Y}$ are positive for these companies; therefore, $Z_x$  and $Z_y$  are both positive, and the product ($Z_x$)($Z_y$)  is positive for these companies.  Most of the remaining companies have lower than average Spending and lower than average Impressions.  Both $Z_x$  and $Z_y$  are negative for these companies, but the product ($Z_x$)($Z_y$) is still positive!  Hence the numerator in (15.1) tends to be a large positive number for the Ad Spending data.

If the points were sloped downwards, then high X-values tend to go with low Y-values, and many points have a negative product ($Z_x$)($Z_y$).  This procedure shows how the correlation formula (15.1) works.  

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
If $X$ and $Y$ tend to be simultaneously above average or simultaneously below average, then the correlation coefficient will be \textbf{positive}.  

If the data is paired above-average X values with below-average Y values, then the correlation coefficient will be \textbf{negative}.

Based on the data, how much do we expect to get for a Saturn car that has been driven 60,000 miles?

Simple linear regression is a data analysis technique that tries to find a \textit{linear} pattern in the data.  We then use this line for prediction.

Notice that the points seem to fall around a \textit{straight line} sloping downwards.  Can we draw this line?  We will discuss one way to do this, called the \textit{least squares} (LS) method.  For now, suppose that the LS line has already been computed (we will do this later).  The LS line is overlayed on the scatterplot looks like Figure 16.1.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Least Squares (LS) Regression Line is overlayed on Scatterplot}



{\centering \includegraphics[width=7cm,height=7cm]{figure/LBL16b-1} 

}




\end{figure}

The formula for this line, in the form $Y= a + bX$,  is 

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Predicted Price} = 8136 + (-0.05127)(\texttt{Miles})
\end{equation*}

The \textit{slope} of the line is -0.05127, which means that predicted Price tends to drop 5 cents for every additional mile driven or about \$512.70 for every 10,000 miles. The \textit{Y-intercept} of the line is \$ 8136; this should not be interpreted as the predicted price of a car with 0 mileage because the range of the data does not include cars with 0 miles.  

We can now use the line to predict the selling price of a car with 60000 miles.  What is the height or Y value of the line at $X = 60000$?  The answer is

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Predicted Price} = 8136 + (-0.05127)(60000) = \$5059.80
\end{equation*}

alternately, about \$5000 or \$5100 or so.

\section{Calculating the Least Squares Regression Line}

One way to calculate the regression line is to use these five statistics:

$$ \bar{X}, s_x, \bar{Y},s_y, \texttt{ and } r  $$

(i.e., the mean and SD of $X$, the mean and SD of $Y$, and the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.)

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The least square regression line is given by the equation

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Predicted} = a + b X
\end{equation*}

where the slope $b$ and the intercept $a$ are calculated as 

\begin{eqnarray}
  b &=& r \frac{s_y}{s_x} \\
  a &=& \bar{Y} - b \bar{X}  \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
}}
\end{center}

Next, we will perform the calculations for the Saturn Price data. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{@{} c rr @{}} \hline 
Car & Miles & Price (\$) \\ \hline
1 & 9300 & 7100 \\
2 & 10565 & 15500 \\
3 & 15000 & 4400 \\
4 & 15000 & 4400 \\
5 & 17764 & 5900 \\
6 & 57000 & 4600 \\
7 & 65940 & 8800 \\
8 & 73676 & 2000 \\
9 & 77006 & 2750 \\
10 & 93739 & 2550 \\
11 & 146088 & 960 \\
12 & 153260 & 1025 \\ \hline
Average & 61195 & 4999 \\
SD  & 50989 & 4079 \\
$r$ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{-0.641} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Using the formulas for slope and intercept in equation (16.1 and 16.2)

\begin{eqnarray*}
b &=& r \frac{s_y}{s_x} = -0.641 \frac{4079}{50989} = -0.05127 \\
a &=& \bar{Y} - b \bar{X} = 4999 - (-0.05127)(61195) = 8136  \\
\end{eqnarray*}

so that the regression line is

\begin{equation*}
PREDICTED = a + b X = 8136 + (-0.05127) X
\end{equation*}

Regarding the original variable names, the regression line is

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Predicted Price} = 8136 + (-0.05127) \texttt{Miles} 
\end{equation*}

\section{More on Simple Regression}

Why is this called the least squares line?  Example best shows the answer.

\begin{table}[ht]


\centering 
\begin{tabular}{@{} c rrrc @{}} \hline 
Car & Miles & Price (\$) & PRED & RES = Y - PRED    \\ \hline
1 & 9300 & 7100 & 7659.35 & -559.35 \\
2 & 10565 & 15500 & 7594.49 & 7905.51 \\
3 & 15000 & 4400 & 7367.11 & -2967.11 \\

6 & 57000 & 4600 & 5213.82 & -613.82 \\
7 & 65940 & 8800 & 4755.47 & 4044.53 \\
8 & 73676 & 2000 & 4358.85 & -2358.85 \\
9 & 77006 & 2750 & 4188.13 & -1438.13 \\
10 & 93739 & 2550 & 3330.24 & -780.24 \\
11 & 146088 & 960 & 646.36 & 313.64 \\
12 & 153260 & 1025 & 278.66 & 746.34 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first car has $Miles = 9300$.  What is its predicted price?  The predicted value is 

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Predicted Price} = 8136 + (-0.05127)(9300) = 7659.35
\end{equation*}

This predicted value missed the actual selling price $Y = 7100$.  By how much? By

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Residual} = 7100 + 7659.35 = -559.35
\end{equation*}

The negative value means actual value is too low.  This difference is called the residual.  

Small residuals (ignoring the sign) are good because this means the prediction was close  (Car 1 above was predicted well, but Car 2 was not -- the selling price is almost double what was predicted).  Therefore, a prediction line is okay if it gives residuals that are as small as possible.  

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{9cm}{
The sum of squared residuals is 
$$ SSE = (-559.35)^2 + \cdots + (746.34)^2 = 107805718.50 $$
}}
\end{center}

and is a measure of `overall size' of the residuals.  In the Saturn Price data, \\
$SSE =  107,805,718$.

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{8cm}{
The least square line given by (16.1) will have a smaller SSE than any other straight line.
}}
\end{center}

This means that if you use any other intercept and slope combination besides $(a,b) = (8136,.05127)$, the new set of predicted values and residuals will give an SSE that is larger than, or at best equal to 107,805,718. 

\section{A 95\% Confidence Interval for Slope}

Is there a linear relationship between X and Y?  It seems evident that selling price (Y) responds to a car's mileage (X), but in science, relationships are often not too noticeable and need confirmation by data.  For example, does an individual's systolic blood pressure (Y) tend to increase with their cholesterol level (X)?   Is there a relationship between one's total number of years of education (X) and income (Y)?  In this section, we will investigate the strength of linear relationships by looking at the slope estimate.  Since the slope represents how much Y responds to changes in the X-value, we will calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the slope, and examine whether it excludes 0.  If it does, then we can rule out the likelihood that the slope is 0.  Thus, we conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

We start by stating the formula for standard error:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The slope estimate $b$ tends to miss the true value $\beta$ by an amount called the \textit{standard error} of the slope, denoted SE of $b$ and calculated as:

\begin{equation}
  SE_b = \sqrt{ \frac{(1 - r^2) s_y^2}{(n - 2) s_x^2}} 
\end{equation}  
}}

The interval estimate is the familiar $b \pm 1.96(SE)$.  It is formally calculated as follows.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
A 95\% confidence interval estimate for the slope of the regression line is given by: 

The slope estimate $b$ tends to miss the true value $\beta$ by 
an amount called the \textit{standard error} of the slope, 
denoted SE of $b$, and calculated as:

\begin{equation}
  b \pm 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{(1 - r^2) s_y^2}{(n - 2) s_x^2}} 
\end{equation}  
}}

If this interval excludes 0, then the likelihood of zero slopes is ruled out, and we conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

Returning to our Saturn car price example, recall that $b = -0.05127$.  The standard error of this estimate is

\begin{equation*}
  SE_b = \sqrt{ \frac{(1 - (-0.641)^2) (4079)^2}{(12 - 2) (50989)^2}} = 0.01942 
\end{equation*}  

The 95\% confidence interval is 

\begin{equation*}
  -.05127 \pm 1.96 (0.01942) 
\end{equation*}  
\begin{equation*}
  (-.09,  -.01) 
\end{equation*}

Since this interval excludes 0, we conclude a significant relationship between car mileage and selling price.

    STEP 1:  In the next six tasks, we will use all of the data from GSS2014 in this exercise.  We have been asked to examine the relationship between a person's income, age, and ``not married'' and a person's happiness.  Here we have variables which are  interval-ratio type of variable.  These types of variables require that we use a Simple Linear Regression (SLR) analysis.  So step 1 in the process of analysis is choosing independent and dependent variables.  Note: In the GSS2014 dataset, {\textit{happy}} is known as GENERAL HAPPINESS, {\textit{income06}} is known as TOTAL FAMILY INCOME, {\textit{age}} is \\ known as AGE OF RESPONDENT, and {\textit{absingle}} is known as NOT MARRIED.

A local bank has been monitoring daily average wait-times for its customers for four weeks. The manager believed that she could improve the wait-times by having one(1) permanent clerk and three(3) floating clerks, instead of the current three (3) permanent clerks. The floating clerks would do other tasks except when the lines became excessive. Last week the manager implemented the new system.

\begin{quotation}
Lengthy television viewing in adolescence may raise the risk for depression in young adulthood, according to a new report.

The study, in the February issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, published by the American Medical Association, found a rising risk of depressive symptoms with increasing hours spent watching television.

Researchers used data from a larger analysis of 4,142 adolescents who were not depressed at the start of the study. After seven years of follow-up, more than 7 percent had symptoms of depression.

But while about 6 percent of those who watched less than three hours a day were depressed, more than 17 percent of those who watched more than nine hours a day had depressive symptoms.

Are kids safer with grandparents driving?

When children are involved in a car accident, they are less likely to be injured if grandma or grandpa are driving rather than mom or dad, a new study suggests.

The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at five years' worth of data on U.S. car crashes involving children younger than 16.

It found that when grandparents were at the wheel, 0.7 percent of children were injured in the crash. That compared with 1 percent when parents were driving.

When the researchers considered other factors -- such as the circumstances and severity of the crash -- kids riding with grandparents were half as likely to be injured, versus those riding with their parents.

Frequency of playing violent video games has at times been linked with and seen as a possible cause for those committing violent acts.  Much debate still looms over whether playing violent video games can lead to a desensitization of violence and a lack of compassion for others.

One article that explores these ideas is titled, The Impact of Degree of Exposure to Violent Video Games, Family Background, and Other Factors on Youth Violence, by the authors Whitney Decamp and Christopher Ferguson.  The authors respond to the concern that violence in video games might contribute to youth violence.  There is still no consensus on whether violent video games may be contributing to violence in youth.  The authors sought to study this issue in an ethnically diverse sample of youth in eighth ($n = 5133$) and eleventh grade ($n = 3886$).  Questionnaire surveys were given to the youth to assess a link.  Independent or predictor variables included the playing of violent video games, and an inclination towards violent video games.  Dependent variables included questions pertaining to hitting with the intention to hurt another and taking part in a fight.

Mixed results were reported.  The authors summarized that violent video game play was not significant in 5 of the models used.  There was, however, a positive correlation between games and violent behavior for the models without controls.   When the authors controlled for the propensity and context, however, this suggested the association to be more spurious (not being what it claims to be).  What other factors may be impacting this outcome?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What possible confounders can you think of for a study of this nature?
  \item Using one confounder from your answer(s) in (1), draw a pathway graph depicting the possible relationships between confounder, possible cause and outcome.

Jet design researchers have come up with two new designs for the wings of a rocket plane. They think both designs are an improvement over the old design but want to know which of their new designs performs better at high altitudes. Specifically, they want to know which new design results in more maneuverability at or above 100,000 feet above sea level. They decide to design a randomized trial to study this.


\begin{enumerate}
  \item The researchers include a control group in their design plan. Describe a possible control group. Why did they add it to the study?
  \item Several pilots and planes are lined up for this study. How could the researchers randomize their experiment to avoid confounders?
  \item One way to measure maneuverability is by surveying pilots about how they thought the jets handled. Could a design that asks pilots this question be blinded? If so, how?
  \item Could the design from (2) be double-blinded? If so, how?
  \item What makes single and double blinding important?

Some students at WMU were curious about whether partying influences GPA. To find out, they surveyed 100 of their WMU peers, asking each peer only two questions: 1) How many hours a week do you party? 2) What is your GPA? The students then compiled their data and performed an appropriate statistical analysis. They concluded that partying does influence GPA, i.e., the more you party, the lower your GPA.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What kind of study design is this?
  \item What are advantages of this study design?
  \item What are disadvantages of this study design?
  \item Did the students overlook anything that might have biased or confounded their results?
  \item Suppose the students wanted to correct for something they overlooked. How could they improve their study design?

Yogurt is known to contain `friendly bacteria' known generally as probiotics which can benefit the gastrointestinal system.  Many strains of bacteria can be found in yogurt, with some of the most common being, \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus}, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, and \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus}.  Further research has been done suggesting probiotics boost the immune system and may even help in weight management and reduction of disease such as cancer.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this using a questionnaire assessing yogurt consumption (yes/no) and asking questions pertaining to the health of the individuals.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First of all, what kind of study design is this?
  \item What are advantages of this type of study design?
  \item What are disadvantages of this study design?
  \item	The researchers then separated the results of the surveys for those who said `yes' they consume yogurt to those who said `no' they do not consume yogurt.  They compared the two groups using these as a treatment and control group.  What is wrong with this assumption?
  \item	Suppose the researchers found that those consuming yogurt had better health and concluded that \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} caused a reduction of weight, improved GI and Immune systems.  What are two major problems in this?
  \item	What may be a bias or lead to confounding in this study?
  \item	How could the researchers improve their study design in order to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} and immune system function?

% Lengthy television viewing in adolescence may raise the risk for depression in young adulthood, according to a new report.
% <<<<<<< HEAD
% =======
% 
% The study, in the February issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, published by the American Medical Association, found a rising risk of depressive symptoms with increasing hours spent watching television.
% 
% Researchers used data from a larger analysis of 4,142 adolescents who were not depressed at the start of the study. After seven years of follow-up, more than 7 percent had symptoms of depression.
% 
% But while about 6 percent of those who watched less than three hours a day were depressed, more than 17 percent of those who watched more than nine hours a day had depressive symptoms.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item The word `raise' in the title implies cause-and-effect, not just association.  When comparing lengthy viewers with those who watch less, what possible    confounders can you think of?

% Are kids safer with grandparents driving?
% 
% When children are involved in a car accident, they are less likely to be injured if grandma or grandpa are driving rather than mom or dad, a new study suggests.
% 
% The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at five years' worth of data on U.S. car crashes involving children younger than 16.
% 
% It found that when grandparents were at the wheel, 0.7 percent of children were injured in the crash. That compared with 1 percent when parents were driving.
% 
% When the researchers considered other factors -- such as the circumstances and severity of the crash -- kids riding with grandparents were half as likely to be injured, versus those riding with their parents.

% Frequency of playing violent video games has at times been linked with and seen as a possible cause for those committing violent acts.  Much debate still looms over whether playing violent video games can lead to a desensitization of violence and a lack of compassion for others.  
% One article that explores these ideas is titled, The Impact of Degree of Exposure to Violent Video Games, Family Background, and Other Factors on Youth Violence, by the authors Whitney Decamp and Christopher Ferguson.  The authors respond to the concern that violence in video games might contribute to youth violence.  There is still no consensus on whether violent video games may be contributing to violence in youth.  The authors sought to study this issue in an ethnically diverse sample of youth in eighth (n=5133) and eleventh grade (n=3886).  Questionnaire surveys were given to the youth to assess a link.  Independent or predictor variables included the playing of violent video games, and an inclination towards violent video games.  Dependent variables included questions pertaining to hitting with the intention to hurt another and taking part in a fight. 
% Mixed results were reported.  The authors summarized that violent video game play was not significant in 5 of the models used.  There was, however, a positive correlation between games and violent behavior for the models without controls.   When the authors controlled for the propensity and context, however, this suggested the association to be more spurious (not being what it claims to be).  What other factors may be impacting this outcome?

To find out, they surveyed 100 of their WMU peers, asking each peer only two questions: 1) How many hours a week do you party? 2) What is your GPA?

% Yogurt is known to contain `friendly bacteria' known generally as probiotics which can benefit the gastrointestinal system.  Many strains of bacteria can be found in yogurt, with some of the most common being, \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus}, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, and \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus}.  Further research has been done suggesting probiotics boost the immune system and may even help in weight management and reduction of disease such as cancer.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this using a questionnaire assessing yogurt consumption (yes/no) and asking questions pertaining to the health of the individuals.

%   \item First of all, what kind of study design is this?
%   \item What are advantages of this type of study design?

%   \item	Suppose the researchers found that those consuming yogurt had better health and concluded that \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} caused a reduction of weight, improved GI and Immune systems.  What are two major problems in this?

% Are kids safer with grandparents driving?
% 
% When children are involved in a car accident, they are less likely to be injured if grandma or grandpa are driving rather than mom or dad, a new study suggests.
% 
% The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at five years' worth of data on U.S. car crashes involving children younger than 16.
% 
% It found that when grandparents were at the wheel, 0.7 percent of children were injured in the crash. That compared with 1 percent when parents were driving.
% 
% When the researchers considered other factors -- such as the circumstances and severity of the crash -- kids riding with grandparents were half as likely to be injured, versus those riding with their parents.

% Frequency of playing violent video games has at times been linked with and seen as a possible cause for those committing violent acts.  Much debate still looms over whether playing violent video games can lead to a desensitization of violence and a lack of compassion for others.  
% One article that explores these ideas is titled, The Impact of Degree of Exposure to Violent Video Games, Family Background, and Other Factors on Youth Violence, by the authors Whitney Decamp and Christopher Ferguson.  The authors respond to the concern that violence in video games might contribute to youth violence.  There is still no consensus on whether violent video games may be contributing to violence in youth.  The authors sought to study this issue in an ethnically diverse sample of youth in eighth (n=5133) and eleventh grade (n=3886).  Questionnaire surveys were given to the youth to assess a link.  Independent or predictor variables included the playing of violent video games, and an inclination towards violent video games.  Dependent variables included questions pertaining to hitting with the intention to hurt another and taking part in a fight. 
% Mixed results were reported.  The authors summarized that violent video game play was not significant in 5 of the models used.  There was, however, a positive correlation between games and violent behavior for the models without controls.   When the authors controlled for the propensity and context, however, this suggested the association to be more spurious (not being what it claims to be).  What other factors may be impacting this outcome?

% Jet design researchers have come up with two new designs for the wings of a rocket plane. They think both designs are an improvement over the old design, but want to know which of their new designs performs better at high altitudes. Specifically, they want to know which new design results in more maneuverability at or above 100,000 feet above sea level. They decide to design a randomized trial to study this.
% 
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item The researchers include a control group in their design plan. Describe a possible control group. Why did they add it to the study?
%   \item Several pilots and planes are lined up for this study. How could the researchers randomize their experiment to avoid confounders?
%   \item One way to measure maneuverability is by surveying pilots about how they thought the jets handled. Could a design that asks pilots this question be blinded? If so, how?

% Some students at WMU were curious about whether partying influences GPA. To find out, they surveyed 100 of their WMU peers, asking each peer only two questions: 1) How many hours a week do you party? 2) What is your GPA?

% Yogurt is known to contain `friendly bacteria' known generally as probiotics which can benefit the gastrointestinal system.  Many strains of bacteria can be found in yogurt, with some of the most common being, \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus}, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, and \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus}.  Further research has been done suggesting probiotics boost the immune system and may even help in weight management and reduction of disease such as cancer.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this using a questionnaire assessing yogurt consumption (yes/no) and asking questions pertaining to the health of the individuals.

%   \item First of all, what kind of study design is this?
%   \item What are advantages of this type of study design?

%   \item	Suppose the researchers found that those consuming yogurt had better health and concluded that \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} caused a reduction of weight, improved GI and Immune systems.  What are two major problems in this?
%   \item	What may be a bias or lead to confounding in this study?
%   \item	How could the researchers improve their study design in order to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} and immune system function?

% As a professional courtesy, physicians have traditionally provided health care free of charge or at a reduced rate to other physicians and their families.  In 1966, 94\% of a sample of 1000 physicians offered this professional courtesy.  The \textit{New England Journal of Medicine} (Nov. 25, 1993) conducted a national survey to see if this practice continues.  It surveyed 2224 physicians who are members of the American Medical Association (AMA) and found that 1957 currently offer free or reduced-rate health care to fellow physicians.  Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the true proportion of physicians who offer professional courtesy has changed since 1966?  Use a significance level of ($\alpha = 0.05$).

% Sports fans often argue that the outcomes of professional basketball games are not decided until the fourth (and last) quarter.  In contrast, the conventional ``wisdom'' in Major League Baseball (MLB) suggests that most nine-inning games are ``over'' by the seventh inning.   Can the outcome of a baseball game really be predicted based on the team leading after seven innings?   So are we correct in assuming the team leading after three-quarters of an NBA game will win the game?  To answer these and other questions, University of Missouri researchers collected and analyzed data for 200 NBA games and 100 MLB games played during the 1900 regular season (Chance, Vol. 5, 1992). The following table reports the number and percentage of games in which the team leading after three quarters or seven innings won.  [Note: Tied games after three quarters were removed from the data set.]  Use a teat of hypothesis to compare the win percentage of NBA teams leading after three quarters to the win percentage of MLB teams leading after seven innings.  Let's use a significance level ($\alpha = 0.05$).

% According to \textit{Havard Business Review} (July-Aug, 1986), approximately two-thirds of the 500 largest U.S. corporations have, in varying degrees, committed some form of unethical behavior.  The lack of ethics in business has led many to question higher education's role in the ethics process.  A more recent study found that the presence of ethics in the business school curriculum is sorely lacking.  In a sample of 94 MBA programs, only 7 required a course on ethics, whereas 18 of 86 sampled undergraduate business programs required an ethics course (\textit{Journal of Education for Business}, Nov-Dec. 1990)

J. S. Carlton et al. conducted a survey of 698 biological scientists from Big 10 universities, asking respondents “When compared with pre-1800’s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?” 652 respondents said global temperatures had risen.

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the \textit{standard error} of the sample proportion?
\item What is the \textit{margin of error} of your sample proportion at a 95 percent confidence level?
\item What is the \textit{confidence interval} for the sample proportion at a 95 percent confidence level?
\item If a larger sample of 1500 is taken - and the sample proportion stays the same - what would be the new standard error?
\item Compare the two standard errors. Which is bigger, by how much?

As a professional courtesy, physicians have traditionally provided health care free of charge or at a reduced rate to other physicians and their families. In 1966, 94\% of a sample of 1000 physicians offered this professional courtesy. The \textit{New England Journal of Medicine} (Nov. 25, 1993) conducted a national survey to see if this practice continues. It surveyed 2224 physicians who are members of the American Medical Association (AMA) and found that 1957 currently offer free or reduced-rate health care to fellow physicians. Is there sufficient evidence to conclude that the true proportion of physicians who offer professional courtesy has changed since 1966? Use a significance level of ($\alpha = 0.05$ ).

\begin{enumerate} 
\item  In 1966, what is t he proportion of physicians who offer free or r educed rate health care as a professional courtesy to other physicians and their families?
\item  In 1993, what is the proportion of physicians who offer free or reduced rate health care as a professional courtesy to other physicians and their families?
\item  What are the hypotheses for this scenario?
\item  Compute the standard error.
\item  Compute the test statistic.
\item  Based on the test statistic and the critical value, what is your decision about the hy- potheses?
\item  Interpret your result in every day language.

Sports fans often argue that the outcomes of professional basketball games are not decided until the fourth (and last) quarter. In contrast, the conventional ``wisdom'' in Major League Baseball (MLB) suggests that most nine-inning games are “over” by the seventh inning. Can the outcome of a baseball game really be predicted based on the team leading after seven innings? So are we correct in assuming the team leading after three-quarters of an NBA game will win the game? To answer these and other questions, University of Missouri researchers collected and analyzed data for 200 NBA games and 100 MLB games played during the 1900 regular season (Chance, Vol. 5, 1992). The following table reports the number and percentage of games in which the team leading after three quarters or seven innings won. [Note: Tied games after three quarters were removed from the data set.] Use a teat of hypothesis to compare the win percentage of NBA teams leading after three quarters to the win percentage of MLB teams leading after seven innings. Let’s use a significance level ($\alpha = 0.05$).

According to \textit{Havard Business Review} (July-Aug, 1986), approximately two-thirds of the 500 largest U.S. corporations have, in varying degrees, committed some form of unethical behavior. The lack of ethics in business has led many to question higher education’s role in the ethics process. A more recent study found that the presence of ethics in the business school curriculum is sorely lacking. In a sample of 94 MBA programs, only 7 required a course on ethics, whereas 18 of 86 sampled undergraduate business programs required an ethics course (\textit{Journal of Education for Business}, Nov-Dec. 1990)

\begin{enumerate}
\item  What is the proportion of MBA programs that required an ethics course?

Session musicians in a studio are worried about their tuning. To get just the right mix, they decide to measure the frequency of the notes they play while recording. They begin by measuring frequency in Hertz at the note ``middle C'' (0 in the table), and work their way up by regular intervals (whole steps) from there.  From ``middle C'' through the first four intervals, they produce the following data:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} rr @{}} \hline
Intervals	& Frequency (Hz) \\ \hline
0 &	261.626 \\
1 &	293.665 \\

Session musicians in a studio are worried about their tuning. To get just the right mix, they decide to measure the frequency of the notes they play while recording. They begin by measuring frequency in Hertz at the note ``middle C'' (0 in the table), and work their way up by regular intervals (whole steps) from there. From ``middle C'' through the first four whole step intervals, they produce the following data:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccc @{}} \hline
Intervals &	Frequency (Hz) \\ \hline
0&	261.626 \\
1&	293.665 \\
2&	329.628 \\
3&	369.994 \\
4&	415.305 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Write the full regression equation, using Intervals as explanatory and Frequency as response. The standard deviations of Intervals and Frequency are, respectively, 1.581 and 60.807. The correlation coefficient is 0.998

  \item	Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the slope of the line. Is the slope statistically significant?  Why or why not?

% The study, in the February issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, published by the American Medical Association, found a rising risk of depressive symptoms with increasing hours spent watching television.
% 
% Researchers used data from a larger analysis of 4,142 adolescents who were not depressed at the start of the study. After seven years of follow-up, more than 7 percent had symptoms of depression.
% 
% But while about 6 percent of those who watched less than three hours a day were depressed, more than 17 percent of those who watched more than nine hours a day had depressive symptoms.

% Are kids safer with grandparents driving?
% 
% When children are involved in a car accident, they are less likely to be injured if grandma or grandpa are driving rather than mom or dad, a new study suggests.
% 
% The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at five years' worth of data on U.S. car crashes involving children younger than 16.
% 
% It found that when grandparents were at the wheel, 0.7 percent of children were injured in the crash. That compared with 1 percent when parents were driving.
% 
% When the researchers considered other factors -- such as the circumstances and severity of the crash -- kids riding with grandparents were half as likely to be injured, versus those riding with their parents.

% Frequency of playing violent video games has at times been linked with and seen as a possible cause for those committing violent acts.  Much debate still looms over whether playing violent video games can lead to a desensitization of violence and a lack of compassion for others.  
% One article that explores these ideas is titled, The Impact of Degree of Exposure to Violent Video Games, Family Background, and Other Factors on Youth Violence, by the authors Whitney Decamp and Christopher Ferguson.  The authors respond to the concern that violence in video games might contribute to youth violence.  There is still no consensus on whether violent video games may be contributing to violence in youth.  The authors sought to study this issue in an ethnically diverse sample of youth in eighth (n=5133) and eleventh grade (n=3886).  Questionnaire surveys were given to the youth to assess a link.  Independent or predictor variables included the playing of violent video games, and an inclination towards violent video games.  Dependent variables included questions pertaining to hitting with the intention to hurt another and taking part in a fight. 
% Mixed results were reported.  The authors summarized that violent video game play was not significant in 5 of the models used.  There was, however, a positive correlation between games and violent behavior for the models without controls.   When the authors controlled for the propensity and context, however, this suggested the association to be more spurious (not being what it claims to be).  What other factors may be impacting this outcome?

% Jet design researchers have come up with two new designs for the wings of a rocket plane. They think both designs are an improvement over the old design, but want to know which of their new designs performs better at high altitudes. Specifically, they want to know which new design results in more maneuverability at or above 100,000 feet above sea level. They decide to design a randomized trial to study this.
% 
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item The researchers include a control group in their design plan. Describe a possible control group. Why did they add it to the study?
%   \item Several pilots and planes are lined up for this study. How could the researchers randomize their experiment to avoid confounders?
%   \item One way to measure maneuverability is by surveying pilots about how they thought the jets handled. Could a design that asks pilots this question be blinded? If so, how?

% Some students at WMU were curious about whether partying influences GPA. To find out, they surveyed 100 of their WMU peers, asking each peer only two questions: 1) How many hours a week do you party? 2) What is your GPA?

% Yogurt is known to contain `friendly bacteria' known generally as probiotics which can benefit the gastrointestinal system.  Many strains of bacteria can be found in yogurt, with some of the most common being, \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus}, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, and \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus}.  Further research has been done suggesting probiotics boost the immune system and may even help in weight management and reduction of disease such as cancer.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this using a questionnaire assessing yogurt consumption (yes/no) and asking questions pertaining to the health of the individuals.

%   \item First of all, what kind of study design is this?
%   \item What are advantages of this type of study design?

%   \item	Suppose the researchers found that those consuming yogurt had better health and concluded that \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} caused a reduction of weight, improved GI and Immune systems.  What are two major problems in this?
%   \item	What may be a bias or lead to confounding in this study?
%   \item	How could the researchers improve their study design in order to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} and immune system function?
