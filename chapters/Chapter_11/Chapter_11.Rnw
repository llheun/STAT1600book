\section{Behavioral Properties of the Sample Average}

What percentage of adult men are between 5'6'' and 6' tall?  Population surveys have shown that men's heights are approximately normally distributed with mean 5'9'' and SD 3''.  Thus, the percentage of men between 5'6'' and 6' is estimated as 68\%, the percentage within 1 SD of the mean.  See Figure 11.1 below.

If the population of men is randomly assigned into groups of 9, and the average heights are computed for each group, what percentage of groups average between 5'6'' and 6' in height?    Is the answer approximately 68\%?  No.  In fact, more than 99\% of the groups will average between 5'6'' and 6', even though only 68\% of individuals do.  Why?  Because averages tend to include tall, short and medium heights -- therefore averages tend to fall closer to the middle than individuals.   (Think about this:  We put in a hat the names of all the men in the class.  We will win \$20 if the names we draw average over 6 feet tall.  Would we instead draw 1 or 2 names?  What are our chances of winning if we draw nine names?)  

The following is a small simulation study of the behavior of the sample mean.  Fifty samples are drawn (each containing $n = 9$ individuals) from a population with mean 69 inches and SD 3 inches.  For each sample, we calculate the average.  Observe that none of the samples average over 71 inches, even though many individuals do.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Heights of 50 samples of Nine Men}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccccccccc @{}} \hline
Sample & (1)&(2)&(3)&(4)&(5)&(6)&(7)&(8)&(9)& Ave \\ \hline
1: &65.5&66.8&68.9&67.8&71.9&66.8&71.0&73.1&62.6&68.27 \\

SD: &3.17&2.56&2.66&3.25&2.94&2.56&3.10&3.33&3.62 & 0.92 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first lesson of this chapter says:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{Averages are less variable than individuals}}

Do we see this in the simulation study?  To make it easier to see, look at the SD of each column.  The SD of individuals tend to be around 3.0 (the actual value), but the SD of averages is much smaller.  How much smaller?  We now state the central lesson of the chapter.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{SD of $\bar{X} = \frac{\texttt{SD of individuals}}{\sqrt{n} }$ }}

Since the individuals in the simulation study have SD of 3 inches, the SD of 9-member averages is:

\begin{equation*}
\bar{X}_{n=9} = \frac{\texttt{SD of individuals}}{\sqrt{n} } = \frac{3}{\sqrt{9}} = 1.0 
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the real value for the SD of the last column is 1.0.  The simulated SD is 0.92, which is close.

\subsubsection{Example 1}

Suppose that men's heights are normally distributed with a mean 5'9'' and a SD 3''.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What percentage of men are over 5'11'' tall?
  \item Select a man at random.  What is the probability that he is over 5'11'' tall?
  \item If we calculate the average height for all possible samples of size nine that we can take, what percentage of averages will exceed 5'11''?
  \item Given one randomly selected sample of size 9, what is the probability that the average height will exceed 5'11''?
  \item Given a sample of size 25, what is the probability that the average height will exceed 5'11''?
  \item Given a sample of size nine, the average height of the sample will exceed \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}} with probability 0.90
  \item 90\% of samples of size nine will have an average height exceeding \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}}.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Estimating the Population Mean}

Consider estimating the average GPA (call this $\mu$) of the approximately 23,000 WMU undergraduates.  In the absence of the complete database, we may wish to estimate $\mu$ by taking a random sample of, say, $n = 25$ students and computing the sample average (call this $\bar{X}$).  Suppose $\bar{X} = 3.05$.  Now, unless we got fortunate with the random sample, chances are the 3.05 estimate missed the true value $\mu$.  By how much?

On the average, a random variable misses its expected value by one standard deviation.  We expect $\bar{X}$ to miss by how much?  one SD of $\bar{X}$.  Using the equation above, we can estimate this by $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$, since the sample standard deviation $s$ estimates the SD of individuals.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The population mean ($\mu$) is estimated using the sample mean ($\bar{X}$).  The estimate tends to miss the $\mu$ by an amount called the \textit{standard error (SE)} of the mean which is calculated as $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$:
$$ SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} $$
}}

Returning to the GPA example, suppose that the sample of $n = 25$ students yielded an average GPA of 3.05 and a standard deviation of 0.40.  Then the WMU population average GPA is estimated as 3.05 with a standard error of $\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{0.40}{\sqrt{25}} = 0.08$.

\subsubsection{Example 2}

What is the average length of stay for undergraduate students at WMU?

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Suppose 25 graduating students were randomly selected and asked about their length of stay.  Suppose that the sample averaged 5.3 years, with an SD of 1.5 years.  Then the WMU average stay is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}}  years give or take \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxx}} years or so. 

  \item A second sample of 100 students were interviewed.   The mean and SD for the second sample were also 5.3 years and 1.5 years, respectively. Calculate an estimate for the WMU average stay and provide a standard error for your estimate.
\end{enumerate}

Similar to the SE for proportions, the formula for the SE of the mean has the sample size (i) in the denominator, and (ii) inside the square root sign.  Therefore, increasing the sample size by a factor of 4 makes the standard error decrease by a factor of $\sqrt{4}$. 

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The standard error (SE) of the mean decreases like the square root of the sample size (n).
}}

\section{Estimating the Population Mean Using Intervals}

Variables tend to miss their expected value, but should be within 1 SD 68\% of the time, and within 1.96 SD's 95\% of the time. Changing notation for SD to SE, we get

\begin{equation*}
| \bar{X} - \mu | \le 1.96 (SE) 
\end{equation*}

95\% of the time, where SE is given by the equation in section 11.3.  As a consequence,

\begin{equation*}
\texttt{Population mean, } \mu \texttt{ is inside the interval } \bar{X} \pm 1.96 (SE) 
\end{equation*}

95\% of the time.  This method gives an interval estimate of $\mu$. 

\vspace{2mm}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\textbf{95\% Confidence Interval for $\mu$} \\
A 95\% Confidence Interval estimate for the population mean $\mu$ is given by 

\begin{equation*}
 \bar{X} \pm 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation*}
}}

\vspace{2mm}

The term $1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$ is called the 95\% margin of error.

\section{Sample Size for Estimating the Population Mean}

If we wanted to reduce the margin of error to some value $ME$, then we set the formula for margin of error equal to $ME$, i.e., $ME = 1.96 \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$.  Solving for $n$ gives the result we need.  

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
In order to be 95\% confident that the sample mean is within a distance $ME$ of the true population $\mu$, choose a sample size equal to 
\begin{equation*}
 n = \frac{1.96^2 s^2}{ME^2}
\end{equation*}
where $s$ is the standard deviation based on historical data or a pilot sample.  The quantity $ME$ is called the 95\% margin of error for $\mu$.
