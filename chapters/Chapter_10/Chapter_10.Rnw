\section{Example 1}

\subsection{Is your colleague Cheating?}

Situation: During a lunch break, a colleague wants to play a game where you each flip a coin six times.  If the result of the flip heads, you win, if the result of the flip is tails your colleague wins.  Suppose the outcome of six plays of the game is T, T, T, T, T, T.  Did your colleague cheat?

Method: Deciding whether your colleague cheated, we need to determine the chance of getting six tails in a row. Let's assume that we are playing with a fair coin so that $P[Tail] = P[Head] = 0.5$ so that each flip is independent.  Next, we should ask, ``is it unusual to have six tails in a row with a fair coin?''


Solution: We need to find the probability of achieving six tails in a row, assuming independence and fairness.

\newpage


\begin{eqnarray*}
P[\texttt{six tails in a row}] &=& P[\texttt{ T and T and T and T and T and T} ] \\
&=& P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \cdot P[T] \\
&=& 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 \\
&=& (0.5)^6 \\
&=& 0.0156
\end{eqnarray*}


If we flipped a \textit{fair} coin six times, 100 different times, we expect between 1 and 2 of the 100 experiments to result in all tails where each experiment consists of six flips of the coin.  So what we observed it is possible but highly unlikely.  Therefore, we can make one of two conclusions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Your colleague is not cheating and very lucky.
\item Your colleague did not use a \textit{fair} coin and cheated.
\end{enumerate}

Is your colleague cheating, or did we see an unusual event?

Here, we use \textit{hypothesis testing}.  We assume reality (in this case, the $P[tail] = 0.5$).  \\ We gather data (sample) to determine whether the data contradicts our assumption.

\subsection{Define Hypotheses Testing}

Definition: Hypotheses testing is a process of using sample data and probability to test the characteristics of one or more populations.  For example, is there a difference in the birth weights between boys and girls.

Here is how we use hypotheses testings.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a statement about the nature of the population(s).
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations.
  \item Select a test method.
  \end{itemize}

\item Analyze the data.
\item Interpret the Results.
\item Communicate our results to the audience.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Definition:} The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) is a statement about the status quo.  For example,  the proportion of (boys and girls) births are equal.

\subsubsection{Definition:} The Alternate Hypothesis ($H_a$) is a statement that we are trying to contradict the $H_0$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
  H_0: P_1 &=& P_2 \\
  H_a: P_1 &\ne& P_2
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Testing Hypotheses }

Two Proportions from Independent Samples.

When the difference, between the observed proportions of sample A and sample B, is similar; we can expect no significance, i.e., ($\hat{p}_a - \hat{p}_b) \sim 0$.  On the other hand, when the proportion is dissimilar, we should expect a significant difference.  We will examine this process shortly.

\subsection{Example 1}

In a survey of drug use among students at WMU, data compared usage of alcohol and \\ smoking. Table 10.1 presents the results of the study:

% Requires the booktabs if the memoir class is not being used
\begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
   \caption{Smoking by using Hard Liquor}
   %\topcaption{Table captions are better up top} % requires the topcapt package
   \begin{tabular}{@{} lcc @{}} \hline % Column formatting, @{} suppresses leading/trailing space
     % \toprule
     &  \multicolumn{2}{c}{Smoker} \\ \hline
     % \cmidrule(r){1-2} % Partial rule. (r) trims the line a little bit on the right; (l) & (lr) also possible
     Hard-Liquor Use & Yes & No \\ \hline
     Once or more & 56 & 15 \\
     Never        & 18 & 23 \\  \hline
     Total        & 74 & 38 \\ \hline
   \end{tabular}

   \label{tab:c10_1}
\end{table}

In this study, the researchers are testing the proportion between non-smokers and \\ smoker.  They believe that the ratio of non-smokers between and smokers are different when drinking hard liquor.  So they set-up an experiment to test the hypotheses at $\alpha = 0.05$.  We should be thinking about the two-tailed test.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the difference between the proportions of smokers and non-smokers when consuming hard liquor, then we might assume that the proportion of smokers also consume hard liquor.
\item Smoking is an independent variable.
\end{itemize}

Now we can consider the above model to solve the situation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item State the hypotheses

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $H_0: P_1 = P_2$,   where $P_1$ is the proportion who smoke.
  \item $H_a: P_1 \ne P_2$, where $P_2$ is the proportion who do not smoke.
  \end{itemize}

\item Formulate an Analysis Plan.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations. ($T_1 = 74$ smokers and $T_2 = 38$ non-smokers)
  \item Compute the standard error of the difference between the two proportions:

  \begin{eqnarray*}
    SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} &=& \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2} \\
             &=& \sqrt{ \frac{\frac{N_1}{T_1} *(1 - \frac{N_1}{T_1})}{T_1} + \frac{\frac{N_2}{T_2} *(1 - \frac{N_2}{T_2})}{T_2} }
  \end{eqnarray*}

  \item Calculate the test statitic:

    \begin{equation*}
    z_0 = \frac{\frac{N_1}{T_1} - \frac{N_2}{T_2}}{SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2}}
    \end{equation*}

  \end{enumerate}


\item Make a statement about the nature of the population(s).
\item Formulate an Analysis Plan.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sampling Distribution is approximately normal
  \item Choose a level of significance equal to 0.05.
  \item Decide the number of observations.
  \item Select a test method.
  \end{itemize}

\item Analyze the data.
\item Interpret the Results.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{itemize}
\item If there is a relationship between drinkers of hard liquor and smokers, then we would assume that more students who never smoked are also non-drinkers of hard liquor. Also, those who drink hard liquor are likely to be smokers.
\item In other words, The proportion of drinkers of hard liquor who smoke is going to be different from the proportion of drinkers of hard liquor who do not smoke.
\item Note: non-smoking (ns) and smoking (s) are the two independent variables.
\end{itemize}

Now let's consider the five-step model introduced above.

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1. Read the problem carefully.
\item Step 2. Stating the Hypotheses

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: P_s & = & P_{ns} \\
H_a: P_s & \ne & P_{ns}
\end{eqnarray*}

\item Step 3.  Deciding the Sampling Distribution and Set up the Critical Region.

<<label=LBL10a, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=
  tmpq <- qnorm(0.975)
  N1   <- 56
  T1   <- 74
  p1   <- N1 / T1
  N2   <- 15
  T2   <- 38
  p2   <- N2/ T2
  # tmpp3<- (56 + 15)/(74 + 38)
  p3   <- sqrt( p1*(1-p1))
  # tmpSEp3 <- sqrt(p3*(1-p3)) * sqrt(1/74 + 1/38)
  SE1  <- sqrt( p1 * (1 -p1)/T1 + p2 * (1 -p2)/T2)
  z1   <- (p1 - p2) / SE1
@

\begin{tabular}{@{} rcl @{}}
Sampling Distribution & = & Approximately Normal \\
Alpha ($\alpha$)  & = & 0.05 \\
Critic Value (CV) & = & \Sexpr{tmpq}
\end{tabular}

\item Step 4.  Computing the Standard Error.

\begin{eqnarray*}
    SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} &=& \sqrt{SE_{\hat{p}_1}^2 + SE_{\hat{p}_2}^2} \\
             &=& \sqrt{ \frac{\frac{56}{74} *(1 - \frac{56}{74})}{74} + \frac{\frac{15}{38} *(1 - \frac{15}{38})}{38} } \\ \vspace{3mm}
             &=& \Sexpr{SE1}
  \end{eqnarray*}

  \item Calculate the test statitic:

    \begin{eqnarray*}
    z_0 &=& \frac{\frac{56}{74} - \frac{15}{38}}{\Sexpr{SE1}} \\ \vspace{3mm}
        &=& \Sexpr{z1}
    \end{eqnarray*}

\item Step 5.  Producing a Decision and Interpreting the Results of the Test.
	\begin{itemize}
	\samepage
	\item Since the test statistic (\Sexpr{z1}) is greater than CV (\Sexpr{tmpq}), therefore, reject the null hypothesis ($H_0: P_s = P_{ns}$).
	\samepage
	\item The interpretation is that there is evidence that the proportion of smokers is different from the proporton of non-smoker when drinking hard liquor.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example 2}    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We have classified a random sample of 100 social work majors regarding whether the Council on Social Work Education has accredited their undergraduate programs (the \emph{independent variable}) and whether they are working in social work positions within three months of graduation (the \emph{dependent variable}).

<<label=LBL10c, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=

  ## p23   <- (25 + 30)/(60 + 40)

From Table 1.2, Can we conclude from these data at a 5 percent level of significance that the proportion of persons working as a Social Worker who graduated from an accedited program is equal the proportion of persons working as a Social Worker who graduated from a non-accedited program?

Now let's consider the five-step model presented above.

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1. Carefully, read the problem description.

\item Step 2. Stating the Hypotheses

\begin{tabular}{@{} ll @{}}

$H_a:$ & $P_{wSW} \ne P_{nSW}$

\end{center}

\item Step 3. Deciding the Sampling Distribution and Set up the Critical Region.

\begin{tabular}{@{} rcl @{}}

Alpha ($\alpha$)      & = & 0.05 \\
Critic Value          & = & $\pm$\Sexpr{tmpq}

\item Step 4.  Computing the Test Statistic.

\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}

Note: The adjacent bell-shaped \\ curve notes the rejection regions (RR) with a significant level 5 percent.  In this case, the test statistic is \Sexpr{z21}.  So it falls in the RR, and we will reject our null \\ hypotheses.

\item Step 5.  Producing a Decision and Interpreting the Results of the Test.
	\begin{itemize}
	\samepage

	\item The interpretation is that there is evidence that the proportion of
social workers working in their field graduated from an accredited program.

\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Errors}

A \textbf{type I error} is rejecting a \textbf{true null hypothesis}.  This error is a false positive.   We commit a type I error when we reject a relationship when it is true.  An example of a Type I error is rejecting the statement MMR vaccine is effective against mumps.

A \textbf{type II error} is failing to reject a \textbf{false null hypothesis}.  This error is a false negative.  We commit a type II error when we fail to reject a relationship when it is false.  An example of a Type II error is a blood test designed to detect clots in patients who have a clot and does not detect it.

When comparing two proportions, concluding the proportions were different when in reality they were not different would be a type I error; concluding the proportions were not different when in reality they were different would be a type II error.

The following table summarizes the above definitions.

 A local city has \\ outsourced some of its planning function.  \\ The contractor has built a database that describes the neighborhoods in the city and has developed a model so that we rate each area for their ``quality of life'' such as noise, open spaces, walkable areas, etc.  She has surveyed a random sample of these districts about \\ their level of satisfaction with their neighborhoods.   Do the results of the study agree with the contractor's objective ratings of quality with the respondents' self-reports of appreciation?

% \textbf{Drug Z} 
The drug Drug Z is a vaccine meant to prevent a certain type of cancer.  It is typically administered to \\ middle-aged subjects starting around 45 \\ years of age.
