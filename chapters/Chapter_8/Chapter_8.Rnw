\label{chap:ch8}

\section{Objective}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe and use the sampling distribution of the proportion.
\item Make and interpret confidence interval of proportions.

\section{The Sample Proportion}

Suppose a student guesses at the answer to every question in a 300-question exam.  If he gets 60 questions correct, then his proportion of correct guesses is $60/300 = 0.20$.  If he gets 75 questions correct, then his proportion of correct guesses in $75/300 = 0.25$.  The proportion of correct guesses is simply the number of correct guesses divided by the total number of questions.

Similarly, if Best Buy's Geek Squad replacement plan sells 60 extended warranties with 300 smartwatches sold, then its protection plan sales rate is $60/300 = 0.20$. If it sold 75 protection plans, this is a sales rate of $75/300 = 0.25$.  The warranty or protection plan sales rate is merely the number of warranties sold divided by the total number of smartwatches sold.

Now, let $X$ denote the number of successes out of a sample of $n$ observations. If each response is a success with probability p independently of the other observations, then $X$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$.  Furthermore, the proportion of successes in the sample is also a random variable and is computed as

\begin{equation*}
  \hat{p} = \frac{X}{n} = \frac{\textit{ Number of successes}}{\textit{ Number observations in the sample}}
\end{equation*}

Since X is expected to be around $np$ give or take $\sqrt{npq}$, then $X/n$ is expected to be around $np/n$ give or take $\sqrt{npq}/n$, or $p$ give or take $\sqrt{pq/n}$.  Make sure that you agree with the last statement before moving on.  It may help to think of this analogy: Suppose annual rainfall in Kalamazoo is expected to be around 24 inches give or take 6 inches.  How do we change the measurement from inches to feet?  We divide both numbers by 12! In feet, annual rainfall in Kalamazoo is expected to be around $24/12$ give or take $6/12$, or 2 feet give or take 0.5 feet.  Now read the first sentence of this paragraph one more time.

Going back to the Best Buy example, the number of protection plans sold is expected to be around $60 \pm 7$.   Thus, the proportion of plans sold is supposed to be about $60/300 \pm 7/300$, or $0.20 \pm 0.02$.

We summarize the formulas for the mean and SD of X and $\hat{p}$ in the following table.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccc @{}} \hline
Random Variable & Mean & SD \\ \hline
$X$ & $np$ & $\sqrt{npq}$ \\
$\hat{p}$ & $p$ & $\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}$  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

}}

\end{minipage}

Data analysis sometimes involves percentages instead of proportions.  Proportions and percentages are two ways of saying the same thing (e.g., we refer to $1/5$ as either 0.20 or 20\%).  How do we convert a proportion to a percentage?  We multiply by 100\%.  To avoid repetition, we present all statistical formulas in proportions.  As Exercise 1 shows, we will convert all the answers to percentages in the end.

Exercise 2 is an example of the law of large numbers.  A more straightforward illustration involves a coin toss.  If you toss a coin repeatedly, which tends to get closer to 50\% heads: 100 tosses or 700 tosses?  The correct answer is 700.  As the number of tosses increases, the closer we expect to get to 50\%.  The reason for this, as the Exercise shows, is the smaller give or take value.  The sample size, $n$, lies in the denominator of the SD of $\hat{p}$.  Therefore, the larger the sample size, the smaller the SD, which happens to be the give-or-take value.

\subsection{Sampling Distribution of p-hat is Approximately Normal}

Since $\hat{p} = \frac{X}{n}$, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ looks the same as that of X except for different numbers on the horizontal axis.  For $n = 30$ and $p = 0.4$, the probability histogram of $X$ and $\hat{p}$ is shown in Figure 8.1.

Therefore, like the binomial, the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ may be approximated by a normal curve with the correct mean and SD.

The question is equivalent to `What is the probability that$\hat{p}$ exceed 0.60?'  Using the mean and SD given in the formula above with $n = 50$ and $p = 0.50$, the sample proportion is expected to be around 0.50 give or take $\sqrt{\frac{0.5 (0.5)}{50}}$ or 0.50 give or take 0.07.  With a mean of 0.50 and a SD 0.07, the area to the right of 0.60 (under the normal curve with mean 0.50 and SD 0.07) is 0.0766.  Thus, the proportion of heads will exceed 0.60 fewer than 8 percent of the time.

}
\end{minipage}

\section{Estimating the Population Proportion p}

The Best Buy computations in the previous section assume that we know the protection plan sales rate is $p = 0.20$.  In data analysis, population parameters like $p$ are typically unknown and estimated from the data.  Consider estimating the proportion p of the current WMU graduating class who plan to go to graduate school.  Suppose we take a sample of 40 graduating students and suppose that 6 out of the 40 are planning to go to graduate school.  Then our estimate is $\hat{p} = \frac{6}{40} = 0.15$ of the graduating class plan to go to graduate school.  Now $\hat{p}$ is based on a sample, and unless we got fortunate, chances are the 0.15 estimate missed.  By how much?  On the average, a random variable misses the mean by one SD.  From the previous section, the SD of $\hat{p}$  equals $\sqrt{ \frac{pq}{n}}$.   It follows that the expected size of the miss is $\sqrt{ \frac{pq}{n}}$.   This last term is the \textit{standard error of estimation of the sample proportion}, or simply \textbf{standard error (SE)} of the proportion.

However, since we don't know $p$, we cannot calculate this SE.  In a situation like this, statisticians replace $p$ with $\hat{p}$  when calculating the SE.  The resulting quantity is called the \textit{estimated standard error of the sample proportion}.  In practice, however, the word ``estimated'' is dropped and estimated SE is called merely the SE.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{The population $p$ is \textbf{estimated using the sample proportion $\hat{p}$}.  This estimate tends to miss by an amount called the \textbf{standard error (SE)} of $\hat{p}$.
}}

\vspace{3mm}

\begin{equation*}
SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\hat{q}}{n}}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Exercise 4}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{109mm}

{\parbox{108mm}{
Fill in the following blanks.

\begin{enumerate}
\item If 6 out of 40 students plan to go to graduate school, the proportion of all students who plan to go to graduate school is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.  The standard error of this estimate is \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.
\item If 54 out of 360 students plan to go to graduate school, the proportion of all students who plan to go to graduate school is estimated as \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.  The standard error of this estimate is \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxx}}.
\end{enumerate}

}}

\end{minipage}

Exercise 4 shows the effect of increasing the sample size on the SE of the sample proportion.  Multiplying the sample size by a factor of 9 (from 40 to 360) makes the SE decrease by a factor of 3.  In the formula for the SE of $\hat{p}$,  the sample size appears (i) in the denominator, and (ii) inside a square root.  Therefore, multiplying the sample size by a specific factor divides the SE of $\hat{p}$ by the square root of that factor.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{As the sample size $n$ \textbf{increases}, the $SE_{\hat{p}}$ \textbf{decreases} like the square root of the sample size.
}}

\section{Estimating Population Proportion Using Intervals}

Variables tend to miss their expected value but should be within \textit{one} SD 68\% of the time, and within 1.96 SD 95\% of the time.  Since the SE of $\hat{p}$ is simply an estimate of the SD, then we can write $| \hat{p} - p | \le 1.96(SE)$ or that $p$ is inside the interval $\hat{p} \pm 1.96(SE)$ 95\% of the time.  In other words, the interval $\hat{p} \pm 1.96(SE)$ contains the true value of $p$ with 95\% certainty.  This method gives us an interval estimate of $p$.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{ \textbf{95\% Confidence Interval for p:} \\ A 95\% confidence interval estimate for the population proportion $p$ is given by

\begin{equation*}
  \hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}
\end{equation*}

}}

The term $1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}$ is the 95\% margin of error, $ME$.

\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval estimate for the true proportion p of WMU students who plan to go to graduate school.
\item If 54 out of 360 students plan to go to graduate school, calculate a 95\% confidence interval estimate for the true proportion p of WMU students who plan to go to graduate school.
\end{enumerate}

\end{minipage}

\section{Sample Size for Estimating the Population Proportion}

If 9 out of 25 randomly selected WMU students live in Southwest Michigan, the 95\% confidence interval for the true proportion is $\hat{p} \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}} = 0.36 \pm 0.19$.  This result says that the true proportion can be as low as 0.17 or as high as 0.55.  If we wanted to reduce the margin of error from 0.19 to some value $ME$, then we set the formula for margin of error equal to $ME$, i.e. $ME = 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \hat{q}}{n}}$.  Solving for $n$ gives the result we need.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
To be 95\% confident that the sample proportion is within a distance of $ME$ of the true proportion $p$, choose a sample size equal to
}}

\vspace{3mm}

\begin{equation*}
 n = (1.96)^2 \frac{ \hat{p} \hat{q}}{ME^2}
\end{equation*}

\vspace{3mm}

where $\hat{p}$ is an estimate based on historical data or a pilot study.  The quantity $ME$ is called the 95\% margin of error for $p$.


\subsubsection{Example:}

Suppose we want to reduce the margin of error for estimating the population proportion from 0.19 to 0.10.  Using the estimate $\hat{p} = 0.36$  based on the initial sample, the sample size we need is: $n = (1.96)^2 \frac{(0.36)(0.64)}{0.10^2} = 89.$  To verify that this is the correct sample size, the 95\% confidence interval would be computed (if the sample proportion remained at 0.36) as $0.36 \pm (1.96) \sqrt{ \frac{0.36(0.64)}{89}} = 0.36 \pm 0.10$.
