\section{Estimates of Center}

Suppose that a random sample of two-bedroom apartments in the Kalamazoo area yields the following data on monthly rent:

\vspace{3mm}

\$635, \$525, \$500, \$800, \$650, \$750, \$555, \$500, \$670, \$675

\vspace{3mm}
How much would we say is the average rent for two-bedroom apartments in Kalamazoo?  In this chapter, we will discuss the sample average and several alternatives to the mean when estimating `average value' in a population.

\subsection{The Sample Mean}

The sample mean is the statistical term for \textit{average of the sample}.  For the example above, the sample mean (denoted $\bar{X}$) is:

$$ \bar{X} = \frac{635+525+500+800+650+750+555+500+670+675}{10} = \$626 $$

Now we may estimate the average rent in Kalamazoo (\$626).  Note that this is an \textit{estimate} based on a \textit{sample}.  Therefore, it is subject to \textit{sampling error}.   Sampling error means that due to the luck of the draw, the sample average likely missed the true population average.  More precisely, the two-word term `sampling error' refers to $| \bar{X} - \mu |$,  the distance by which the \textit{sample} average $\bar{X}$  misses the population average  $\mu$.

The advantages of the sample mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is easy to understand and simple calculate.
\item It is based on all the values.
\item It is not based on the position in the series.
\end{itemize}

The disadvantage of the mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is always affected by outliers, which are relatively small or relatively large data values.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Sample Median}

There are alternative ways to estimate average rent if we want to avoid the effect of outliers.  We can determine the sample median, instead of the sample mean.  We have discussed the sample median (denoted MED) earlier in Chapter 1.  We compute it as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $n$ represents the total number of observations.
\item Order the $n$ observations from smallest to largest.
\item Then calculate $0.50(n + 1)$ to locate the center value of the dataset.
\item If $0.50(n + 1)$ is an integer, then MED is the $0.50(n + 1)^{th}$ ordered observation.
\item If $0.50(n + 1)$ is not an integer, then MED is the average of the two adjacent ordered observations.
\item There are $n = 10$ observations in our rental data.  We first order them from smallest to largest.
\end{enumerate}


$$ 500, 500, 525, 555, 635, 650, 670, 675, 750, 800 $$

Now, $0.50(n + 1) = 0.50(10 + 1) = 5.5$.  Since this is not an integer, we average the $5^{th}$ and $6^{th}$ largest observations:

$$MED = \frac{(635 + 650)}{2} = \$642.50$$

The advantage of the median is that it is more robust than the mean, i.e., the median is not as affected by extreme values (outliers).

\subsection{The Trimmed Mean}

Since the mean uses all observations in the calculation, it can be strongly affected by outlying small and large values.  What happens to the average when the value \$500 is replaced by \$400?  It will become smaller.  What happens to the median?  It remains unchanged.

The trimmed mean is a compromise estimator that looks a lot like a mean but is less sensitive to extreme values.  The 10\%-trimmed mean removes the lowest 10\% and highest 10\% of the data, then take the sample mean of the remaining data.  In the rental example, 10\% of the data is one observation. We remove the lowest
observation (\$500) and the largest observation (\$800), and take the mean of the remaining eight observations:

$$\bar{X} = \frac{635+525+650+750+555+500+670+675}{10} = \$620$$

What if 10\% of the data is not an integer?  For example, if $n = 23$, then 10\% of n is 2.3.  Since we cannot remove 2.3 observations, we will remove three observations from each end (to ensure at least 10\% protection) and take the average of the middle 17 observations.


\section{Estimate of Spread (or Uncertainty or Variation)}

Recall the data on the monthly rent of two-bedroom apartments in the Kalamazoo area:

$$ 500, 500, 525, 555, 635, 650, 670, 675, 750, 800 $$

If a future student asks, \textit{What should a two-bedroom apartment cost us in rent?} How should we reply? Knowing that the data averages \$626, we might say something like \textit{Around \$626, give or take $\dots$(?)}.   This second number tells us how much uncertainty there is in our guess.  In other words, the student's rent will probably miss \$626, but by how much?   We will get to the answer in a minute.   
For a second example, if we were going to San Francisco for a couple of days in August, and we want to know what clothes to bring, it is not enough to know that the average temperature is 68 degrees.  If it was 68 degrees, \textit{give or take} 15 degrees, then we will need a sweater.  If it is 68 degrees, \textit{give or takes} 30 degrees, we might need a winter coat.

Variation presents itself everywhere.  Consider weight loss.  The 77 subjects in the Atkins group lost an average of 10.5 pounds \textit{give or take} 15 pounds.  Compare this to an average of 3.5 pounds for the Zone diet \textit{give or take} 14 pounds. How about bowling?  In his first seven games in a tournament in Indiana, Walter Ray Williams Jr. averaged 228, \textit{give or take} 34.   Notice how the \textit{give or take} a number seems to complete the description.

In this chapter, we will discuss the sample standard deviation, where it describes the spread in a group of numbers with the number \textit{give or take}.


In this chapter, we will discuss the sample standard deviation, which is typically used as the \textit{give or take} a number to describe spread in a group of numbers.

\subsection{The Sample Standard Deviation}

We compute the standard deviation (or SD) using a series of steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the mean.
\item Subtract the mean from each observation. These are the deviations from the mean or \textit{Deviations}.
\item Square the deviations from the mean. These are the \textit{Squared Deviations}.
\item Take the sum of squared deviations called the \textit{Sum of Squares} or \textit{SS}.
\item Compute SD using the equation: $$SD=\sqrt{\frac{SS}{n-1}}$$ where \textit{n} is the number of observations.
\end{enumerate}

The table below shows the computations for the monthly rent data. Notice in the last row that the sum of the deviations from the mean is 0. It will always be the case for the sum of deviations from the average.


<<label=LBL3a, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=
  rent31 <- c(635,525,500,800,650,750,555,500,670,675)
  mn31   <- mean(rent31)
  diff31 <- rent31 - mn31
  SS31   <- diff31^2
  sum31  <- numeric(3)
  sum31[1] <- sum(rent31)
  sum31[2] <- sum(diff31)
  sum31[3] <- sum(SS31)
  tbl31 <- cbind(rent31, diff31, SS31)
  tbl32 <- rbind(tbl31, sum31)
  colnames(tbl32) <- c( "Rent", "Deviations", "Squared Deviations")
  rownames(tbl32) <- c('1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','Sum')
  xtable(tbl32, digits=0)
  tmp31 <- sprintf("%.1f", sqrt(sum31[3]/9))
  tmp32 <- sum31[3]
@

$$ SD = \sqrt{ \frac{ SS}{n - 1}} = \sqrt{ \frac{ \Sexpr{tmp32}}{9}} \approx \Sexpr{tmp31} $$

It is helpful to get a feel for the numbers in the second column.  The first value 9 says that \textit{635 is nine above average}.  The next number (-101) says that \textit{525 is 101 below average}.  Ignoring signs, the numbers in the second column represent the \textit{give or take} from the average.  To get the actual SD, we take the Sum of Squares and divide by $(n - 1)$, and finally, take the square root of that answer.  It gives us a final SD of 104.158.  We say that monthly rent averages \$626, \textit{give or take} \$104.


Look at the second column again.  Ignoring signs, these are the distances from the mean.  Which rental is closest to it? The answer is \$635, which is missed by 9. Which rental value is farthest from the average?  \$800, which failed to hit it by 174. What is the average \textit{size of the miss?}  It should be somewhere between the smallest and largest. Right.  It is how we interpret the SD: \textit{On the average, the monthly rentals miss the mean by \$104}.

Taken together, the mean and SD allow comparison of both relative size and spread of two groups of numbers.  In the professional bowling tournament in Indiana that he won in November of 2008, here are Walter Ray Williams Jr.'s first seven  games and last seven games (including the final):

   \begin{tabular}{@{} | lccc | @{}} \hline

      Last seven  & 246,244,247,248,237,258,246 & 246.6 & 6.2 \\ \hline
   \end{tabular}
   % \caption{Remember, \emph{never} use vertical lines in tables.}
   % \label{tab:booktabs}
\end{table}

What does the mean and SD tell us?  He averaged higher in the end but was also more consistent with a \textit{give or take} of only 6 points!  His earlier games had more massive swings: from a low of 163 to a high of 279, resulting in the SD of 34.

\subsection{Effect of Multiplication and Addition by a Constant}

Recall that monthly rent for apartments average \$626 with an SD of \$104.  If the student plans to get a roommate and pay only half the rent, how much does he expect to pay?  If we are thinking of dividing both numbers by two, i.e., \$313 \textit{give or take} \$52, this is correct.

\begin{center}
Original rent: $ 626 \pm 104 $ \hspace{2cm}	Half the rent: $ 313 \pm 52 $
\end{center}

Now suppose that the student does not want a roommate.  The parents agreed to contribute \$100 for the rent each month.  How much does the student expect to pay after a subsidy of \$100?  If we are thinking of subtracting \$100 from both numbers, i.e., \$426 \textit{give or take} \$4, there is an error in our thinking.  Here the SD remains the same, i.e.,

\begin{center}
Original rent: $ 626 \pm 104 $ \hspace{2cm} Subsidized rent: $ 526 \pm 104 $
\end{center}

If we are not convinced, consider the data itself on the following table.

\subsection{Risk ratio and odds ratio}   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 In clinical studies, statisticians frequently take ratios of proportions or probabilities (instead of differences).  There are several reasons for this idea.  Sometimes, the disease or medical event of interest is quite rare, i.e., $p_1 = 0.0008$.  If a new treatment reduces the probability of getting the disease to 0.0006, the difference in probabilities is quite small and hard to assess $((p_1 - p_2) = 0.0002)$.  In the meantime, the ratio $ \frac{p_2}{p_1} = \frac{0.0006}{0.0008} = 0.75 $ means that the risk of getting the disease under the new treatment has been reduced by 25\%.

A technical reason for using ratios is that it can control for other variables such as age and race.

\subsection{Risk ratio}

Following is the abstract of the study ``Safety and Efficacy of a Recombinant Hepatitis E Vaccine.''  % \citep{shrestha2007}

\subsubsection{Background}

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a significant cause of viral hepatitis.  We evaluated
the safety and efficacy of an HEV recombinant protein (rHEV) vaccine in a phase
2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

\subsubsection{Methods}

In Nepal, we studied 2000 healthy adults susceptible to HEV infection who were randomly assigned to receive three doses of either the rHEV vaccine or placebo at months 0, 1, and 6. They used active (including hospital) surveillance to identify acute hepatitis and adverse events. The primary endpoint was the development of hepatitis E after three vaccine doses.

\subsubsection{Results}

A total of 1794 subjects (898 in the vaccine group and 896 in the placebo group) received three vaccine doses; researchers followed the total vaccinated cohort for a median of 804 days.  After three vaccine doses, hepatitis E developed in 69 subjects, of whom 66 were in the placebo group.  The vaccine efficacy was 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6).  In an intention-to-treat analysis that included all 87 subjects in whom hepatitis E developed after the first vaccine dose, nine subjects were in the vaccine group, with a vaccine efficacy of 88.5\% (95\% CI, 77.1 to 94.2).  
There were two sub-groups: adverse events at the injection site, and the reactogenicity sub-group during the 8-days after the administration of each dose.  The proportion of subjects with adverse events was similar in the two study groups except that the vaccine group had more injection site pain than the placebo group ($p = 0.03$).

%%
\subsubsection{Conclusion}

In a high-risk population, the rHEV vaccine was more effective in the prevention of
hepatitis E.

The data given in the `Results' part of the abstract may be summarized as follows.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
 & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
 Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
 Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

We may present data for comparing proportions in a \textit{2 by 2} table.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
 & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
 Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
 No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

The risk ratio also called the relative risk is the ratio of probabilities:

\begin{equation*}
  RR = \frac{ \frac{P(Disease)}{Exposure}}{ \frac{P(Disease)}{No Exposure} } = \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{c}{c + d} } = \frac{p_1}{p_2}
\end{equation*}

For our example, we can define and calculate the risk ratio as

\begin{equation*}
  RR = \frac{ \frac{P(Disease)}{Exposure}}{ \frac{P(Disease)}{No Exposure} } = \frac{ \frac{3}{898}}{ \frac{66}{896} } = \frac{0.00334}{0.07366} = 0.045
\end{equation*}

It means that getting the vaccine reduces our risk to only 4.5\% of the original, or has 95.5\% efficacy.



\subsection{Odds ratio}

The odds of an event occurring is

\begin{equation*}
  Odds = \frac{ \texttt{Probability that event occurs}}{\texttt{Probability that event doesn't occur}} = \frac{p}{q}
\end{equation*}

For example, if you win a game a 20\% of the time ($p = 0.20$), then our odds of winning is $( \frac{0.20}{0.80}) = \frac{1}{4}$.  We say that we have a \textit{1-in-4} odds of winning, or we win once for every four times we lose.  If we win 80\% of the time, the odds are $\frac{0.80}{0.20} = 4$. It means we have \textit{4-in-1} odds of winning, or we win four times for every one time we lose.  Here is a table of odds corresponding to various probabilities.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cc @{}} \hline
Probability & Odds \\ \hline
0.10 & 1/9 = 0.11 \\
0.20 & 1/4 = 0.25 \\
0.50 & 1/1 = 1.00 \\
0.80 & 4/1 = 4.00 \\
0.90 & 9/1 = 9.00 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Unlike probabilities, odds can be greater than 1.  The odds ratio is just the ratio of two odds (usually for comparing two groups).

\begin{equation*}
  Odds Ratio = \frac{ \texttt{Odds of Group 1}}{\texttt{Odds of Group 2}} = \frac{ \frac{p_1}{q_1}}{ \frac{p_2}{q_2}}
\end{equation*}

Returning to the hepatitis E study, recall the disease occurrence data:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
 & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
 & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
 Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
 Placbo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}

The disease rate for each group is

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)} = \frac{0.07366}{(1 - 0.07366)} = 0.07952
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)} = \frac{0.00334}{(1 - 0.00334)} = 0.00335
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
  \texttt{Odds Ratio} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)}}{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)}} = \frac{0.07952}{0.00335} = 23.7
\end{equation*}

We say that ``the odds of getting hepatitis is 24 times greater if we remain unvaccinated.''

Odds ratios are generally easier to interpret if they are more significant than one.  We can always ensure this by choosing which group to put in the numerator, i.e., the one with more substantial odds.

It is essential to understand that the odds ratio is not a ratio of the likelihood of probabilities.  If the disease rates for men and women are 0.80 and 0.40, respectively, then the odds ratio is

\begin{equation*}
   \frac{ \frac{0.80}{0.20}}{ \frac{0.40}{0.60}} = 6.00
\end{equation*}

In this example, men are twice as likely to get the disease but have six times the odds.

% \subsection{A 95\% confidence interval for odds ratio}
% 
% We write the confidence interval formulas for odds ratios (OR) for the natural logarithm, similarly to risk ratios.  Consider a 2 by 2 table as before.
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% The odds of disease occurrence in the exposed group is $\Big[ \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{b}{a + b}} \Big] = \frac{a}{b} $.  Similarly, the odds in the unexposed group is $\frac{c}{d}$.  Hence, the odds ratio of disease occurrence is
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{OR} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Disease|Exposed)}}{\texttt{Odds(Disease|Not Exposed)}} = \frac{a/b}{c/d} = \frac{p_1 / q_1}{p_2 / q_2} =\frac{p_1 \times q_2}{p_2 \times q_1}= \frac{ p_1 \times (1- p_2)}{ p_2 \times (1 - p_1)}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% If $OR < 1$, we can put the `not exposed' group in the numerator, so that $OR > 1$  (the resulting odds ratio should, of course, be interpreted accordingly).  In our hepatitis example, we can use the following table:
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% and get $OR = ((66)(895))/((830)(3)) = 23.7$ (``Placebo group has 24 times the odds of getting hepatitis''). If we use
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{hepatitis E} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Vaccine & 3 & 895 & 898 \\
%  Placebo  & 66 & 830 & 896 \\
%   \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% then $OR = (3)(830)/(66)(895) = 0.04$ (``Vaccine group has 0.04 times the odds of getting hepatitis'').
% 
% In either case, we will calculate the confidence interval for odds ratio in 4 steps.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Calculate the natural log of the odds ratio:
% \begin{equation*}
%   ln(OR) = ln \Big( \frac{a \times d}{b \times c} \Big)
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item	Calculate the standard error of ln(OR) as follows:
% \begin{equation*}
%   SE_{ln(OR)} = \sqrt{ \Big( \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} \Big)}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item A 95\% confidence interval for ln(OR) is given by
% \begin{equation*}
%   [ ln(OR) - 1.96(SE), ln(OR) + 1.96(SE)]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item Finally, a 95\% confidence interval for OR is given by
% \begin{equation*}
%    e^{ln(OR) - 1.96(SE)}, e^{ln(OR) + 1.96(SE)}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Returning to the hepatitis E study, recall the disease occurrence data:
%

% 
% The odds ratio of getting hepatitis is
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   \texttt{Odds Ratio} = \frac{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Placebo)}}{\texttt{Odds(Hepatitis|Vaccine)}} = \frac{66 \times 895}{3 \times 830} = 23.7
% \end{equation*}
% 
% so that
%

% \subsection{A 95\% confidence interval for risk ratio}
% 
% We write the confidence interval formulas for the natural logarithm of RR.  Consider a 2 by 2 table as before.
% 
% \begin{table}[ht]
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{}} \hline
%  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Disease} \\
%  & Yes & No & Total \\ \hline
%  Exposure & a & b & $a + b$ \\
%  No Exposure  & c & d & $c + d$ \\ \hline
%  \end{tabular}
%  \end{table}
% 
% We will calculate the confidence interval for RR in 4 steps.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Calculate the \textbf{natural log (ln)} of the risk ratio:
% $$ ln(RR) = ln \left( \frac{ \frac{a}{a + b}}{ \frac{c}{c + d} } \right) $$
% 
% \item Calculate the standard error of ln(RR) as follows:
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%    SE_{ln(RR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{c} - \frac{1}{a + b} - \frac{1}{c + d}}
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item A 95\% confidence interval for ln(RR) is given by
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   [ ln(RR) - 1.96 (SE), ln(RR) + 1.96 (SE) ]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item Finally, a 95\% confidence interval for RR is given by
% 
% \begin{equation*}
%   \Big[ e^{ln(RR) - 1.96 (SE)}, e^{ln(RR) + 1.96 (SE)} \Big]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Returning to our example,
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
% ln(RR) = ln(0.045) = -3.101
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
% SE_{ln(RR)} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{66} - \frac{1}{898} - \frac{1}{896}} = \sqrt{0.3462} = 0.5884
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%  [ -3.101 - 1.96(0.5884), -3.101 + 1.96(0.5884) ] = [ -4.254, 1.948]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \item
% \begin{equation*}
%   \Big[ e^{-4.254}, e^{-1.948} \Big] = [ 0.014, 0.143 ]
% \end{equation*}
% 
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% With 95\% confidence, the risk of getting hepatitis with the vaccine is only 1.4\% to 14.3\% of placebo.  It means that the vaccine reduces our risk by as low as 85.7\% or as high as 98.6\%.  Now read the Results section of the abstract again.  They say ``The vaccine efficacy was 95.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 85.6 to 98.6).''  The two sets of the numbers match, (slight discrepancy due to rounding error.)
