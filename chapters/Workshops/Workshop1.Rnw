A local bank has been monitoring daily average wait-times for its customers for four weeks. The manager believed that she could improve the wait-times by having one(1) permanent clerk and three(3) floating clerks, instead of the current three (3) permanent clerks. The floating clerks would do other tasks except when the lines became excessive. Last week the manager implemented the new system. 

Old Policy:   5, 7, 10, 11, 18, 4, 4, 4, 14, 21, 0, 7, 8, 9, 18, 6, 6, 12, 22, 25 \\ 
New Policy: 4, 3, 9, 13, 17

Were waiting times longer using the ``Old Policy'' or the ``New Policy?''  To answer this question, calculate the following for both the old and new policies.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw comparison dotplots for the samples above.
  \item For each sample, calculate the mean AND median.  Locate (place) these on your dotplots, clearly distinguishing between the two.
  \item What is the mode for the old policy?
  \item Calculate the 10\% trimmed mean for the old policy.  How does this change from the regular mean?

According to a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in June 2009, 110 people ages 18 to 29 years said that religion is very important to them. Suppose this result is based on a sample of 250 people ages 18 to 29 years.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the sample estimate of the proportion of all people ages 18 to 29 years who will say that religion is very important to them?
  \item What is the standard error of this estimate?
  \item Using the normal curve and assuming your estimate from a. is representative of the population proportion, what is the probability that more than 45\% of people ages 18 to 29 years say that religion is very important to them?

% Lengthy television viewing in adolescence may raise the risk for depression in young adulthood, according to a new report.
% <<<<<<< HEAD
% =======
% 
% The study, in the February issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, published by the American Medical Association, found a rising risk of depressive symptoms with increasing hours spent watching television.
% 
% Researchers used data from a larger analysis of 4,142 adolescents who were not depressed at the start of the study. After seven years of follow-up, more than 7 percent had symptoms of depression.
% 
% But while about 6 percent of those who watched less than three hours a day were depressed, more than 17 percent of those who watched more than nine hours a day had depressive symptoms.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item The word `raise' in the title implies cause-and-effect, not just association.  When comparing lengthy viewers with those who watch less, what possible    confounders can you think of?

% Are kids safer with grandparents driving?
% 
% When children are involved in a car accident, they are less likely to be injured if grandma or grandpa are driving rather than mom or dad, a new study suggests.
% 
% The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, looked at five years' worth of data on U.S. car crashes involving children younger than 16.
% 
% It found that when grandparents were at the wheel, 0.7 percent of children were injured in the crash. That compared with 1 percent when parents were driving.
% 
% When the researchers considered other factors -- such as the circumstances and severity of the crash -- kids riding with grandparents were half as likely to be injured, versus those riding with their parents.

% Frequency of playing violent video games has at times been linked with and seen as a possible cause for those committing violent acts.  Much debate still looms over whether playing violent video games can lead to a desensitization of violence and a lack of compassion for others.  
% One article that explores these ideas is titled, The Impact of Degree of Exposure to Violent Video Games, Family Background, and Other Factors on Youth Violence, by the authors Whitney Decamp and Christopher Ferguson.  The authors respond to the concern that violence in video games might contribute to youth violence.  There is still no consensus on whether violent video games may be contributing to violence in youth.  The authors sought to study this issue in an ethnically diverse sample of youth in eighth (n=5133) and eleventh grade (n=3886).  Questionnaire surveys were given to the youth to assess a link.  Independent or predictor variables included the playing of violent video games, and an inclination towards violent video games.  Dependent variables included questions pertaining to hitting with the intention to hurt another and taking part in a fight. 
% Mixed results were reported.  The authors summarized that violent video game play was not significant in 5 of the models used.  There was, however, a positive correlation between games and violent behavior for the models without controls.   When the authors controlled for the propensity and context, however, this suggested the association to be more spurious (not being what it claims to be).

% Yogurt is known to contain `friendly bacteria' known generally as probiotics which can benefit the gastrointestinal system.  Many strains of bacteria can be found in yogurt, with some of the most common being, \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus}, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, and \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus}.  Further research has been done suggesting probiotics boost the immune system and may even help in weight management and reduction of disease such as cancer.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this using a questionnaire assessing yogurt consumption (yes/no) and asking questions pertaining to the health of the individuals.  
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item First of all, what kind of study design is this?
%   \item What are advantages of this type of study design?
%   \item What are disadvantages of this study design?
%   \item	The researchers then separated the results of the surveys for those who said `yes' they consume yogurt to those who said `no' they do not consume yogurt.  They compared the two groups using these as a treatment and control group.  What is wrong with this assumption?
%   \item	Suppose the researchers found that those consuming yogurt had better health and concluded that \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} caused a reduction of weight, improved GI and Immune systems.  What are two major problems in this?
%   \item	What may be a bias or lead to confounding in this study?
%   \item	How could the researchers improve their study design in order to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} and immune system function?

% Yogurt is known to contain `friendly bacteria' known generally as probiotics which can benefit the gastrointestinal system.  Many strains of bacteria can be found in yogurt, with some of the most common being, \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus}, \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, and \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus}.  Further research has been done suggesting probiotics boost the immune system and may even help in weight management and reduction of disease such as cancer.  A group of researchers decided to investigate this using a questionnaire assessing yogurt consumption (yes/no) and asking questions pertaining to the health of the individuals.  
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item First of all, what kind of study design is this?
%   \item What are advantages of this type of study design?
%   \item What are disadvantages of this study design?
%   \item	The researchers then separated the results of the surveys for those who said `yes' they consume yogurt to those who said `no' they do not consume yogurt.  They compared the two groups using these as a treatment and control group.  What is wrong with this assumption?
%   \item	Suppose the researchers found that those consuming yogurt had better health and concluded that \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} caused a reduction of weight, improved GI and Immune systems.  What are two major problems in this?
%   \item	What may be a bias or lead to confounding in this study?
%   \item	How could the researchers improve their study design in order to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of \textit{Lactobacillus bulgaricus} and immune system function?

%     % A paint manufacturer fills cans of paint using a machine that has been calibrated to fill the cans to contain an average of 128 ounces each.  To test whether their machine has come out of calibration, the manufacturer takes a random sample of 25 cans and finds that they average 129.3 ounces with a standard deviation of 2.8 ounces.  Is this strong evidence that the filling machine is set too high and thus is no longer calibrated properly? (Use significance level 0.05)

% A statistics instructor designed an experiment where one section was taught to 12 students (Group A) using the conventional procedure. The second section of 10 students (Group B) was prepared the same course using programmed materials. When the semester ended, the instructor administered the same examination to each group. Group A with 12 students had a mean grade of 85 with a standard deviation of 4, while Group B with ten students using programmed materials had a mean grade of 81 with a standard deviation of 5. The statistics instructor tested the hypothesis that the two methods of learning are the same using a 0.10 level of significance.
