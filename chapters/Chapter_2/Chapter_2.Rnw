\section{Objectives}

After completing this part, students should be able to:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{

\begin{itemize}
\item Recognize the types of variables (categorical or numerical) and give examples of each type.

\item Compute the relative frequency.
\item Use graphical methods to display data.
\end{itemize}
}}

\section{Statistics and Data}

\textbf{Statistics} refers to a collection of techniques and procedures for analyzing data.  In this context, statistics may be considered a synonym of data analysis.  In a narrower context, \textit{statistics} is sometimes synonymous with the numbers themselves, such as in \textit{demographic statistics} or \textit{baseball statistics}.  \textit{Data} refers to any collection of measurements that a researcher makes on several subjects.  Researchers often store these measurements in a row-and-column display called a spreadsheet.  The following example shows a spreadsheet containing data taken on ten students in a class.

  \begin{table}[htbp]
   \centering
  \begin{tabular}{@{} p{14mm} p{13mm} p{20mm} p{9mm} p{32mm} p{18mm} p{21mm} @{}} \hline % Column formatting, @{} suppresses leading/trailing space
   \multicolumn{7}{c}{CLASS DATA} \\
   %\multicolumn{7}{c}{Class Hours} \\
   Student & Gender & Level & GPA & Credit Hrs Taken & Transport & Hrs Slept \\ \hline
   1 & M & Sophomore & 3.10 & 32 & Car & 7 \\
   2 & M & Junior & 3.20 & 66 & Car & 8 \\
   3 & F & Senior & 3.49 & 94 & Bus & 8 \\
   4 & M & Senior & 2.68 & 89 & Walk & 10 \\
   5 & F & Junior & 3.73 & 69 & Bicycle & 8 \\
   6 & F & Junior & 3.39 & 59 & Car & 8 \\
   7 & F & Senior & 3.80 & 86 & Walk & 8 \\
   8 & M & Junior & 3.11 & 75 & Car & 8 \\
   9 & F & Sophomore & 3.10 & 27 & Car & 7 \\
   10 & M & Senior & 3.10 & 96 & Walk & 3 \\ \hline
   \end{tabular}
   \end{table}

Each row represents a subject (or student, in this case), and each column represents a measurement.  Researchers call the measurement columns 
variables because the values vary from one patient to another.

\section{Classification of variables}   

\subsection{Levels of Measurement}

It is useful to distinguish between \textbf{four levels of measurements} for variables, ranked from weakest to strongest; Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio.  These will be defined shortly. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Nominal Variables}

Nominal variables (NV) are \textbf{categorical variables} that have two or more categories without having any logical sequence or order. For example, gender is an NV since \textit{males} and \textit{females} are the names of a homogeneous class.  Additional qualitative variable examples include religious affiliation, language, and nationality.   There is no intrinsic ordering between these.  We often use bar charts and pie charts to represent these data.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item You cannot perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, \\ multiplication, etc.
\item No order or logical sequence is present
\item Only names
\end{itemize}
}}

\item \textbf{Ordinal Variables}

Ordinal variables are \textbf{categorical variables} with a rank ordering.  A student's level of standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior) is ordinal.  They are also names of categories, but unlike gender, they are rank-ordered.   However, we cannot subtract them, and distances do not make sense.  Other examples of ordinal variables include Likert scale items in which we rank items.  Completing surveys or even end of semester evaluations, we can rank on a scale of 1-5 (often from strongly disagree to agree strongly).

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Be careful about the size of the difference between categories that may not be equally spaced.
\item Only order matters not the difference between categories
\end{itemize}
}}

\item \textbf{Interval Variables}

Interval variables are \textbf{numerical variables}, where the difference between the two values is meaningful.  GPA is an interval measurement; we can subtract these measurements, and distances make sense.  For example, the span from 2.3-2.4 is the same as 3.7-3.8.  However, ratios do not make sense; is 4.0 `twice as high' as 2.0?  The answer is no.  The grading system would work just as well on the scale (A, B, C)=(5.0, 4.0, 3.0) instead of (4.0, 3.0, 2.0).

\item \textbf{Ratio Variables}

Ratio variables are \textit{numerical variables} with true zero.  The number of credit hours is a ratio measurement.  A student who has completed 90 credit hours has twice as many as 45 credit hours and three times as many as 30 credit hours.  Another example is the speed of an automobile that has true zero mph when it is not moving.  A speed of 40 mph is twice as fast as 20 mph.
\end{enumerate}

It is useful to recognize a hierarchy of information in the sense that \textit{a measurement level contains several facts greater than or equal to the level below it}.  At lower levels of measurement, data analyses tend to be less sensitive and sophisticated.  A statistical study should aim for the highest level of length measurement possible or affordable.

\subsection{Numerical versus categorical variables}

Interval and ratio variables together are often called \textbf{numerical} variables or \textbf{quantitative} because they provide a number which measures \textit{quantity} (how much, how many) of something.

Nominal and ordinal variables together are often called \textbf{categorical} variables because they classify rather than count or measure.  It is tempting to think of categorical variables as \textit{non-numerical}, but sometimes they do consist of numbers.  For example, \textit{Social Security (SS) number} consists of numbers, but are used more as labels rather than quantities.  Hence, the SS number is categorical.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Dependent versus independent variables}

Another classification for variables is dependent and independent. This distinction is relevant in studies that investigate cause and effect.  The independent variable is the probable cause.  We also refer to this as the predictor or explanatory variable.  The dependent variable is the outcome variable that is affected by the independent variable.

\vspace{3mm}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
In cause-and-effect studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{independent} variable is the probable cause.
\item The \textbf{dependent} variable is the outcome being caused/affected.
\end{itemize}

The following is a description of a clinical study on the possible link between vaccines and autism.   In particular, the study tries to find an association between the amount of a mercury-containing preservative in vaccines and measures of brain function in children.   It has one independent variable (amount of mercury in vaccines) and 42 dependent variables (measures of brain function).  Similar to two previously published studies, it found no evidence of neurologic problems in children exposed to mercury-containing vaccines. \citep{thompson2007}
%The paper is titled \textit{Early Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years} by William W. Thompson et al. (New England Journal of Medicine, 2007 Sept; Vol. 357, pp.1281-92).

%\subsubsection{Background}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Background}

Others have speculated that early exposure to thimerosal (a vaccines preservative) causes Cognitive deficit in children.

%\subsubsection{Methods}
\item \textbf{Methods}

William W. Thompson enrolled 1047 children between the ages of seven and ten years and administered standardized tests assessing 42 neuropsychological outcomes. We did not assess autism-spectrum disorders. We determined exposure to mercury from thimerosal from computerized immunization records, medical records, personal immunization records, and parent interviews.  We obtained the information on potential confounding factors from the interviews and medical charts. We assessed the association between current neuropsychological performance and exposure to mercury during the prenatal period, the neonatal period (birth to 28 days), and the first seven months of life.

%\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\item \textbf{Conclusion}

Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years.
\end{enumerate}

Researchers use the following 42 variables to measure brain function:

\begin{itemize}
\item speech and language (comprehension of instruction, recalling sentences, and stuttering,
\item tests on verbal memory (no delay, short delay, long delay),
\item tests on motor coordination (grooved pegboard, and finger tapping),
\item tests on behavior regulation (hyperactivity, and inattentiveness),
\item presences of tics (motor and phonics), and
\item tests on intelligence (verbal (IQ), and full-scale (IQ)).
\end{itemize}

Most of these are numerical test scores.  Others are categorical, as the presence of stuttering (Yes-No) and tics (Yes-No).

Note that the researcher has a choice of whether to use numerical or categorical measures of brain function.  Even for categorical outcomes, there is a choice between nominal (i.e., Yes-No) or ordinal (Frequently-Sometimes-Never). Many surveys like to use the ordinal five-point scale:

{\small{
\begin{enumerate}
\item Strongly agree
\item Agree
\item Neither agree nor disagree
\item Disagree
\item Strongly disagree
\end{enumerate}
}}

It is called a \textit{Likert item}.  The scores from adding up several Likert items are said to be on a \textit{Likert scale}.  Western Michigan University's course evaluation uses a Likert scale on some topics.

\section{Summarizing Categorical Data}

The Census Bureau conducts a separate nationwide survey on population and information.  Called the American Community Survey (ACS), it is \textit{designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing}. The ACS collects population and housing information every year instead of every ten years.  The following ACS data is a sample of actual responses from the state of Michigan and Indiana in 2008.

The variables \textit{State} and \textit{Type of Payment} are categorical.  The following variables  are numerical: \textit{No. of bedrooms},  \textit{Monthly Payment}, and \textit{12-month Household Income}.

\subsection{Relative Frequency Table}     %%

A \textit{relative frequency table} gives the count for each category and the relative frequency or percentage of time in which each category occurs.  Here is a table for Monthly Payment type.

<<label=LBL2a, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=
  DT1 <- read.csv("data/ACSdata.csv", header=TRUE)

  attach(DT1)
  MP1 <- numeric(76)
  ## names(DT1)
  v1 <- table(Type.of.Payment)
  v2 <- v1 * 100 / sum(v1)
  Total <- c( 76, 100)
  tmp1 <- cbind(v1, v2)
  t1 <- rbind(tmp1, Total)
  colnames(t1) <- c( "Frequency", "Relative Frequency(%)")
  xtable(t1, caption="Relative Frequency Table for Type of Monthly Payment", digits=0)
  MP1 <- Monthly.Payment
  tmp2 <- sort(MP1)
  MP2 <- tmp2[13:76]
  MP3 <- tmp2[13:75]
@

To compute Relative Frequency, divide Frequency by the total and multiply by 100\%.  For example,

\begin{equation*}
RF(Mortgage) = \frac{\text{Mortgage Frequency}}{\text{Total Frequency}} = \frac{44}{76} \times 100 = 57.9
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Pie Chart}

A pie chart gives the same information as a bar chart, except in a circular shape.  We also use pie charts for categorical data. Some people prefer the look of pie charts over bar charts.  However, studies have shown that people have difficulty comparing the relative size of wedges.  When using this type of figure, we should only consider it when the number of variables is less than six, and we will use bar charts when we have more than six.  Look at the pie chart below.  Is rent less than half or more than half of Mortgage?

<<label=LBL2c, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.width="10cm", out.height="10cm">>=

  pie(v2, main="Pie Chart for Type of Payment")

@


\newpage

\subsection{Bar Chart}

A \textit{bar chart} is a plot of the relative frequency table.  We use bar charts for categorical data. The order of the categories is arbitrary.  Sometimes we show the order of decreasing frequency for aesthetic purposes (a Pareto figure).  Some statistical packages reveal the nominal variable alphabetically unless otherwise specified.

<<label=LBL2b, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.width="8.0cm", out.height = "7cm" >>=

  barplot(v2, main = "Bar Plot for Type of Payment", xlab="Type of Monthly Payment", ylab="Relative Frequency", col="green", ylim=c(0,60))

\section{Summarizing numerical data}

Remember that the	\textit{mean} and \textit{median} cannot be used for nominal variables.

Consider the variable Monthly Payment in the ACS housing data on page 24.  How do the numbers appear?  How large are they? Is it able to assume different numerical values?  Are there any extreme values? These questions are attempts at getting to know the data.  In this section, we discuss tools for getting to know numerical data better.  We have $n = 64$ observations available since 12 households (out of 76) do not have monthly payments.  Here is a list of the monthly payments:

{\small{
\Sexpr{MP1}
}}

Now, we sort the observations from smallest to largest:

{\small{
\Sexpr{MP2}
}}

The smallest observation is \$140.  The largest is \$5200, which is an \textbf{outlier}.

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{In data analysis, an \textbf{outlier} is an observation that falls far from the rest of the data. It may need to be checked for correctness if there is any possibility of a clerical error.}}

\vspace{3mm}

Can this be a typographical error that we need to correct?  When we look closely at the data, we see it belongs to observation 28, which is a mortgage for a household with a \$358,000 annual income.  We can infer that it is probably correct, so we leave it alone. The simple act of sorting the data already gives us more information about monthly payments.  For example, we can now see that the typical monthly payment falls around \$700.  We also recognize the extent to which the \$5200 value is outlying. We now turn to better ways to visualize the \textbf{spread} of this data.

\subsection{Stem-and-Leaf Plot}


<<label=LBL2d, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=
  
  DT2 <- c(15.4,9.9,19.6,17.1,15.0,11.7,8.2,10.9,17.2,13.9,16.9,11.2,13.0,12.8,15.2,10.1,13.2,17.0,16.2,11.7,9.1,11.1,13.5,10.5,20.6,14.4,13.2,10.2,11.9,7.4,9.3,19.3,15.0,15.4,11.4,13.5,13.3,12.0,11.0,12.9,13.9,13.6,15.8,16.6,8.6,9.2,10.5,11.0,15.2,10.3,9.7)

@

Graphs help summarize information in the data, especially for large datasets.  Below, we illustrate a two-year average percentage of persons living in poverty (2008-2009) in the U.S.A. in a graph called a stem-and-leaf plot.  The numbers on the left are stems, while the numbers on the right are called leaves.



\begin{minipage}[ht]{7cm}

\end{minipage}


{\small{

<<label=LBL2f, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=

  tmp0 <- sort(Monthly.Payment)
  ## tmp0[13:76]
  tmp1 <- as.integer(tmp0[13:76] / 200)
  tmp2 <- as.factor(tmp1)
  tmp3 <- table(tmp2)
  tmp4 <- tmp3*100/sum(tmp3)   ## compute percentage
  tmp5 <- cbind(tmp3, tmp4)
  colnames(tmp5) <- c( "Frequency", "Relative Frequency(%)")
  rownames(tmp5) <- c("0-200", "200-400", "400-600", "600-800", "800-1000", "1000-1200","1200-1400", "1400-1600", "1600-1800","2400-2600", "5200-5400")

  xtable(tmp5, caption="RF Table of Monthly Payment for ACS Housing Data", digits=0)

@

}}

There are three things to keep in mind when constructing a frequency table. First, decide how many classes (i.e., intervals) we want.  This also determines the \textit{class width}.  Try to have 5 to 15 intervals, depending on how many observations we have. Second, decide where the first interval starts.  Third, decide how to avoid boundary disputes.

The last item requires us to choose a \textbf{boundary convention}.  For instance, we could write the intervals for the frequency table above as follows:

\vspace{3mm}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{@{} l @{}} \hline
0-199 \\
200-399 \\
400-599 \\
600-799 \\
etc. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{6cm}

\begin{center}

\begin{tabular}{@{} l @{}} \hline
$ [0-200)$ \\
$ [200-400)$ \\
$ [400-600)$ \\
$ [600-800)$ \\
 etc. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{center}

\end{minipage}

\vspace{3mm}

This way, it is easier to tell that \$200 belongs to the second interval, not the first.  However, the table looks more complicated, harder to read.  To keep the range of values simple but avoid boundary disputes, include a footnote to the table that describes the boundary convention, i.e., \textit{Intervals contain the left endpoint, but not the right}.  Then, we know that \$200 belongs to the second interval, not the first.  Alternatively, we may use square braces and right parenthesis.

It also means that the class intervals contain the left endpoint but not the right.  Which method do we prefer?

We show the distribution of numbers using the relative frequency table in a compact numerical way.  If we plot the frequencies as columns, the resulting plot is called a \textit{histogram}.

The histogram and stem-and-leaf plots look alike, except that the stem-and-leaf plot has columns that go sideways instead of upwards.  Stem-and-leafs are better if we want the data values themselves available from the plot.  However, the histogram can handle large sample sizes easily and is more flexible in choosing class widths.  For example, we may choose class widths of \$500, as follows: $[0,500), [500,1000), [1000,1500), \dots, [5000,5500)$, which stem plots cannot do.

@

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dot Plot}

For moderately large samples, a \textit{dotplot} diagram is a quick way to see repeating data values.  We present the dot-plots of the resting pulse rates among college students before and after exercise.  As we observed using side-by-side dots plots, we find that the distance between after and before exercise spread (maximum minus minimum) is wider that makes sense.

We find that the distance, after exercise spread (maximum minus minimum), is longer than before exercise, that makes sense.  We also see that six students of the 28 had a pulse rate of 68 beats per minute.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Dot Plot }

   A1  <- B1 + rnorm(n=28, mean=10, sd=5)
   Pulse <- c(B1, A1)
   Time_ <- c(rep("Before", 28), rep("After", 28))

   bwidth <- 1
   dfrm <- data.frame(Pulse, Time_)
   ggplot(data=dfrm, aes(x = Time_, y =  Pulse, fill = Time_)) +
     geom_dotplot(binwidth=bwidth, binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center") +
     coord_flip()

\newpage

\subsection{Box-and-Whisker Plot}

A box-and-whisker or boxplot shows useful information about the data includes the measures the central tendency and the variability of the distribution.  First, order the data from smallest to largest.  What is the range of the first (or smaller) half of the data?  The smallest quarter of the data?  The next quarter?  The box-and-whisker plot or boxplot is a graphical picture of the distribution of quarters of the data.  Consider once again monthly payments from the ACS housing data.  We list them here sorted from smallest to largest (minus the outlier  (\$5200)).


{\small{
\Sexpr{MP3}

     %  {\small{
     %  140  190  200  200  220  230  250  280  290  340  340  350  370  380  380

     %  }}

There are $n = 63$ observations.  One-quarter of the data is $\frac{63}{4}=15.75$, or approximately 16 observations.  The boxplot below gives the range of each quarter of the data: the range of the first quarter (i.e., the lowest 16 monthly payments) is the left whisker.  The range of the 2nd quarter is the left part of the box, the 3rd quarter the right part of the box, and the range of the last quarter is the right whisker.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

More precisely, the software draws vertical lines at (140, 400, 700, 970, 2400).  Hence, the lowest 16 monthly payments lie within (\$140, \$400).  The next set of 16 observations lies within (\$400, \$700).  The third set lies within (\$700, \$970).  Finally, the last 16 values lie within (\$970, \$2400).  The five values (140, 400, 700, 970, 2400) that divide the data into quarters and form the fences and whiskers of the boxplot are collectively called the five-number-summary of the data.  They are often denoted as MIN, $Q_1$, MED, $Q_3$, and MAX, respectively.

% \newpage

{\small{
\begin{enumerate}
\item	\textbf{MIN} is called the \textbf{minimum} and is the smallest of the ordered observations.
\item	\textbf{$Q_1$} is the median of the lower half of the data.  Also, the is the upper boundary of the first quarter and is called the \textbf{first quartile}.
\item	\textbf{MED} is the upper boundary of the second quarter and is called the \textbf{second quartile}.  However, it also divides the data into lower and upper halves and is more often called the median.
\item	\textbf{$Q_3$} is the median of the upper half of the data.  Also, it is the upper boundary of the third quarter and is called the \textbf{third quartile}.
\item	\textbf{MAX} is the largest of the ordered observations and is called the \textbf{maximum}.
\end{enumerate}
}}

Boxplots are particularly useful for comparing two distributions side-by-side.  Below are boxplots of mortgage data, and rent drew parallel to each other on the same scale.  When comparing data of mortgages and rental, we find that mortgages tend to be larger than rent since the median and quartiles are larger.  There is also a considerable difference in the spread, with the mortgage data having a long right tail, evidence that mortgages have a higher ceiling than rent.

Different statistical computing packages have different ways of computing the quartiles, but the differences are minimal.  In this class, we can calculate the quartiles as follows.  First, arrange the observations from the smallest to the largest ($n^{th}$ ordered observation).  Then

\fbox{\parbox{14.5cm}{
$Q_1$ is the $.25(n+1)^{th}$ ordered observation. \newline
MED is the $.50(n+1)^{th}$ ordered observation. In other words, the median is the middle value or the average of the two middle values \newline
$Q_3$ is the $.75(n+1)^{th}$ ordered observation.
}}

If .25(n+1) is not an integer, take the average of the two adjacent ordered observations, similarly for MED and $Q_3$.  Here again, are the ($n = 63$) ordered observations of monthly payments.

\Sexpr{MP3}

% {\small{
% 140  190  200  200  220  230  250  280  290  340  340  350  370  380  380
%       400  420  440  450  490  500  500  500  510  530  550  560  650  670  670

%      1500 1800 2400
% }}


Since .25(63+1)=16, then $Q_1$ is the $16^{th}$ ordered observation.  Hence $Q_1 = 400$.  Similarly, \\ 0.50(63+1)=32 so MED=700.  Finally, .75(63+1)=48, so $Q_3 = 970$.

If $n = 64$, then .25(64+1) = 16.25, so that $Q_1$ would be the average of the $16^{th}$ and $17^{th}$ ordered observations.  Therefore, if we return the \$5200 outlier we removed, then the five-number-summary would be (140, 410, 700, 980, 5200).

\subsection{Symmetry and Skewness}

The term `skew' refers to the direction of the most extended tail when you flip the stem-and-leaf sideways or draw a histogram. See histogram examples below. A long-tail denotes the presence of extreme or outlying observations.  The left-skewed histogram contains values that are small and outlying, while a right-skewed histogram would have values that are large and outlying.  A left skew also indicates that the smallest quarter of observations will be more spread out.

% label=LBL2n, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.width="4cm">>=
