\section{Randomized trials}

In the previous chapter, we covered unknown confounders, one of the most critical threats to valid comparisons in statistics. In this chapter, we will explore elements of study design that help statisticians deal with the danger of bias posed by hidden confounders. One of the aspects of many study designs is appropriate randomization in the selection of subjects for the study and to different groups within it. Without such randomization, results of data analyses can be biased. Let's see by way of example, how randomization can help us address the threat of results biased by hidden confounders.

Recall the diet study discussed previously: ``Comparison of the Atkins, Zone, Ornish, and LEARN Diets for Change in Weight and Related Risk Factors Among Overweight \\ Premenopausal Women The A TO Z Weight Loss Study: A Randomized Trial'' by C.D. Gardner et al. (JAMA, Vol. 297, pp. 969-77, March 2007)

\begin{quotation}
 \textbf{Objective:} \\ To compare four weight-loss diets representing a spectrum of low to high carbohydrate intake for effects on weight loss and related metabolic variables. The researchers designed a randomized trial of 311 free-living women.  The subjects were overweight/obese (body mass index 27-40),  nondiabetic, and premenopausal.   It took place in the United States from February 2003.  Intervention participants were randomly assigned to follow the Atkins (n=77), \\ Zone ($n = 79$), LEARN ($n = 79$), or Ornish ($n = 76$) diets and received weekly instruction for 2 months, then an additional 10-month follow-up.
\end{quotation}

Here is an example of a randomized trial or randomized experiment.   Subjects entering the test are randomized, using a virtual roll of a die, into one of several treatment groups.

The randomization into groups eliminates the main threat to valid comparisons: \\ confounders.  How?  By making the comparison groups similar to each other in all aspects, except for the treatment.  Think about it.  If you ask for volunteers to each treatment group, then most of the meat-eaters would go to the Atkins group, and most of the vegetarians would go to the Ornish group.   Would it then surprise you if one group had, say, more Asians than another group?  Or more smokers?  Or less physical activity?  Randomized assignments, instead of volunteering, are the best way to get balanced groups in the factors that we think might matter and achieves balance in all other factors we have not even considered.

Table \ref{tbl51} on page \pageref{tbl51} presents the characteristics (averages or frequencies) of the subjects after randomization, but before treatment has started.  Researchers use descriptive statistics to achieve the right balance among the groups in demographics and anthropometric variables (using either percentages or averages and standard deviations, respectively), and known health risk factors.  All other variables, essential or not, like IQ, shoe size, and preference for country music, would also tend to be balanced, thus providing a level of protection against unknown confounders.

\subsection{Double blind randomized controlled trials (RCT)}

We should use randomization for scientific studies as described above whenever possible. But it might surprise you to learn that randomization is just one way to address hidden confounders and bias of an estimator in clinical trials. The present section will cover \textit{controls and blinding}, two critical elements in study design that address confounders and systemic error of an estimator.

Thus far, we have discussed how vital randomly assigning subjects in a study to groups within that study is to overcome bias.  Study designers should be aware that there is some luck involved in randomization. It is not always likely, but it is possible, that even the best randomization techniques leave unknown confounders present across all \textit{subjects} within the study. We may be selecting subjects for the experiment from a population where they all have a confounding characteristic in common. In such a case, it would not help us much to randomly assign subjects to different groups of the study since all the groups would end up exhibiting the same bias regardless of how we selected the participates. Imagine attempting to conclude whether a medication is effective in treating the common cold by studying the only subjects, who have some particular resistance to the cold. No patients would get severe colds, or if they did, they would not manifest many cold symptoms like coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose. It may sound hard to study such subjects.  Right? Yes, the immune response confounder makes these subjects hard to explore, but this problem is solvable. Scientists need more \textit{control} in assessing such matters and their hidden confounders, so control \textit{groups} are added to scientific studies to correct for this problem.

Researchers do not expect that the control group of the study to respond in the same way as to the treated group.   For instance, control groups in medical studies are often groups of patients given inert placebos or ``sugar pills'' instead of active medications. Since the study directors do not provide these groups with active medication, such groups are not expected to exhibit effects as strong as the treatment groups who receive medications.  We would not expect patients who receive sugar pills to miraculously feel relief from their cold symptoms in the same way patients who receive a new alternative to pseudoephedrine might. Even when such placebo groups do exhibit effects like the expected treatment effects, which can be due to the placebo effect or other hidden confounders (different resistance to the cold), the presence of these control groups within the study gives researchers a valid point of comparison. It is true that both the placebo and medicated groups selected from our cold-resistant population of patients would be asymptomatic. However, even though there is less sneezing when comparing the medicated and unmedicated groups, the response allows scientists to determine if it is just the patients' robust immune responses or the psychological impact of taking a pill is responsible, or if the medication is exceptionally effective at treating the cold.

\end{figure}

When one of the comparison groups in a study is a control group or placebo, randomized trials are sometimes called randomized controlled trials, or randomized controlled experiments. As much as possible, researchers try to conduct \textit{double-blind} randomized controlled trials, when neither the doctor nor the patient knows what treatment the patient is receiving.  In the common cold example, some patients get a sugar pill or placebo while others get a new alternative medication thought to treat cold symptoms.  (The critical point to remember here is that in a double-blind-controlled experiment both the \textit{patients} and \textit{doctors} have no idea if a patient is receiving the sugar pill/placebo or the cold medicine.) This method gives each patient a pill that looks identical regardless of whether it is the inert placebo or the active drug.

% \end{minipage}

Can you spot the difference? -- Single Blinding.  Can your doctor? -- Double Blinding. 

This double-blinding is essential because it offers additional protection against bias. In such studies, all groups have the same frame of mind (as opposed to knowing you are not getting the new drug). Similarly, the experimenter has the same frame of mind evaluating patients from each group. You might wonder, isn't it enough to single-blind the study, to make sure that just the patients are unaware whether they received the placebo or medicinal pill? No, it is not. Imagine an experimenter who administers both the placebos and medications but does so know which is which. That researcher might unintentionally treat these two groups differently, perhaps just by spending an extra minute with patients from the medicated treatment group or by approaching them with a little more enthusiasm. It's this sort of unwitting behavior that can invite bias into the study.

\section{Observational studies}

There are situations where researchers cannot compare treatments.  Therefore, they cannot randomly assign subjects to different treatment groups,  for example,  the study involving women and leg fractures.  We compared leg fracture rates of two groups, men and women.  Whenever a new subject enters the experiment, e.g., by having a car accident, we \textit{observe} what gender they belong to, instead of randomly assigning it to a control or treated group.  Studies like these are called \textit{observational studies}, as opposed to randomized experiments.  In the hierarchy of scientific evidence, we do not consider observational studies as reliable as randomized trials (the gold standard). Since the subjects of observational studies assign themselves to a different group, there may be a selection bias that leads to confounders (like the women in the leg-fracture-study being shorter).  We can control the effects of known confounders in the analysis.  For example, we can compare leg fracture rates of men and women with the same heights.  Investigators will need to anticipate potential confounders and control for them. We enumerate common reasons for nonrandomized studies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assigning treatment is impossible (e.g., to compare fracture rates between men and women, we cannot randomize subjects into the comparison groups).

\item Assigning treatment is unethical (e.g., to compare cancer rates of smokers and nonsmokers, we do not want to randomize subjects into smoker-nonsmoker     comparison groups.)  In other words, we do not force nonsmokers to smoke.

\item Assigning treatment is impractical (e.g., the outcome is a rare event like cancer or stroke, and a randomized trial would need too many subjects and too much time).  In cases like these, a case-control study is generally the way to go.
\end{enumerate}

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
\textbf{Observational studies} are conducted when \textbf{randomization} to treatment groups  \\ is \textbf{impossible}, \textbf{unethical}, or \textbf{impractical}.
}}

Returning to the leg-fracture example, we stick to observational studies in such a case for two reasons. As described above, it's impossible to perform the research any other way with the data collected. But we also \textit{should not} elect to collect the data in a randomized manner.  In other words, we should not even try to get the bias-reducing benefits of randomization because of ethical constraints. To perform randomized clinical trials in this experiment of leg fractures, we would need to randomly select subjects where we \textit{would} break legs for the sake of the study.
 Causing suffering like this is prohibited by several codes of ethics like the Nuremberg Code, a system of research ethics drafted after the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.  These criminals included scientists who designed and performed inhumane experiments. Beyond the official ban, though, such research is wrong in its causing undue suffering and its infringement upon fundamental human rights.

Another reason we may conduct an observational study is that they can be more practical compared to randomized controlled trials. It can be due to the constraints of an experiment, or the cost of a randomized study would entail.  A researcher might want to study whether regular exercise can prevent a rare form of cancer.  Randomization would require that we randomly select patients first, group them along with exercise programs (say regular, irregular, and no exercise), and wait to see how the different groups respond (do the exercise groups have significantly fewer cases of cancer?).  This study might not work out at all because, since the cancer is rare, it's possible that no or very few of our subjects will get cancer.  It also may take many years before cancer would appear.

This study would be quite time-consuming and labor-intensive. We can imagine all the financial resources that we need to do all that exercise-monitoring over all the patients and years! This experiment brings us to our second point that observational studies are practical because they tend to be less costly than randomized controlled trials. Companies often use statistics to generate revenue, but they tend to do this not by randomized experiments, but by analyses of marketing data they collect through sales or surveys. Nonrandom observational studies like analyses of sales data are a relaxed approach in that all they require are a data collection apparatus and a statistician. For instance, clothing designers want to keep up with trends in consumer spending but might sell hundreds of different garments to thousands of outlets across the world. When sales of one item begin to slip, it might be difficult to notice amidst all the chaos of such a business enterprise. A statistician can help here by analyzing the proportions of revenue generated by each garment from month to month and making recommendations about which products to push when. The statistician might even find a style or color-based pattern that repeat themselves seasonally, allowing the company to adjust before their sales ever begin slipping.

\subsection{Case-control studies}

Instead of randomizing subjects into diet groups and then comparing the weight loss outcome, a case-control study would look for people in the population who lost weight, and then ask them what diet they used.  Thus, you start with the \textit{outcome} and then work back to the type of treatment.  These are also classified as \textit{retrospective} studies because they review former studies and compare weight loss or disease rates of various procedures.  Randomized experiments are necessarily \textit{prospective}, in the sense that you randomize treatment and then later see which groups lost more weight or had more disease.

We frequently use case-control studies because they are cheaper and easier to conduct since it generally requires a survey of a database, instead of expensive and time-consuming recruitment and handling of subjects.  There are plenty of successful case-control success stories in the scientific literature. 

The first study formally linking lung cancer to smoking was a 1950 case-control study ``Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung'' by Richard Doll and A. Bradford Hill(British Medical Journal, 1950 September 30; 2(4682): page 739--748).  Using patients in 20 hospitals in London, they found that lung-cancer patients had higher rates of smokers than a comparable control group of patients.   For example, among district hospitals, 48 out of 98 lung cancer patients smoked 15 or more cigarettes daily.  In contrast, only 30 out of 98 non-cancer patients smoked 15 or more cigarettes daily.  

In general, case-control studies can conclude a link or `association' but are not able to prove `causation.'   However, case-control studies provide initial evidence that can generate resources for more rigorous studies like double-blind, randomized controlled trials.  In the case of smoking and lung cancer, randomized trials are unethical, but given the eventual results of multiple studies, the scientific community now accepts that smoking causes lung cancer.  
\citep{doll1950}

\subsection{Case-crossover studies}

Sometimes, a subject can be its control.  This method is called a case-crossover study because of subjects in the treatment group ``crossover'' to the control group.  An example is a 1997 study linking cell phone use to car accidents: ``Association between cellular-telephone calls and motor vehicle collisions'' by D.A. Redelmeier and R.J. Tibshirani (The New England Journal of Medicine, 1997 February 13; Vol 336, pp. 453-8).  The subjects were people who reported a collision to the North York Collision Reporting Centre between July 1, 1994, and August 31, 1995. Among these, 742 had cell phones and consented to participate in the study.  Instead of asking each person whether they were using their cell phone during the time of the collision (an unreliable method), the investigators examined their detailed phone billing records.  The results of the experiment follow below:

\begin{quotation}
Overall, 170 subjects (24 percent) had used a cellular telephone during the 10-minute period immediately before the collision. Five percent (37) had used the telephone during the same period on the day before the collision. And Two percent (13) had used the telephone during both periods. The crude analysis indicated that cellular-telephone activity was associated with a relative risk of a motor vehicle collision of 6.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.5 to 9.9).  The primary analysis, adjusted for intermittent pauses, indicated that cellular-telephone activity was associated with a quadrupling of the risk of a motor vehicle collision (relative risk, 4.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 6.5).

	\end{exercise}
	\begin{solution}  % 2

Randomized controlled experiments are necessary to establish the cause of such a disease firmly. For instance, we might see if potassium deficiency causes the disease, we may give our treatment group a potassium supplement every day. However, if the illness is rare, then it is impractical for us to use a randomized controlled experiment.  It would also be unethical to be influencing or causing disease in people potentially.  Additionally, we would have no guarantee that any subjects would even develop the disease if it is sporadic. Thus, observational studies may be the most appropriate choice unless scientific advances in, say, genetics are far enough along to make a more practical kind of randomized controlled experiment.

  \begin{solution}  % 4

A randomized controlled experiment is the ``gold standard of scientific knowledge'' so that it would be the best way to study this situation. We would study four groups of patients: group one would get a standard treatment for an illness, group two would get a placebo without being told it's a placebo, group 3 would get a placebo and told it's a placebo, and group 4 would get no treatment at all. This method would, interestingly, give controls both from the standard and no-treatment groups. The groups for primary comparisons would be the two groups that get the placebos and are either informed or not.

Yes, there are potential confounders.
