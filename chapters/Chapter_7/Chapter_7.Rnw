\section{Binomial Probabilities}

A sequence of n observations is called a binomial process if

\begin{enumerate}
\item each observation results in one of two possible outcomes (which we call    success and failure)
\item the probability of success is p, and the probability of failure is q = 1 - p for all observations
\item the observations are independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccc @{}} \hline
Obs 1 & Obs 2 & Obs 3 & $\cdots$ & Obs n \\
$p \swarrow  \searrow q$ & $p \swarrow  \searrow q$ & $p \swarrow  \searrow q$ & & $p \swarrow  \searrow q$ \\
S \hspace{3mm}   F & S  \hspace{3mm}  F &  S  \hspace{3mm}  F &  & S \hspace{3mm}   F \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Let X denote the total number of successes among the n observations.  Then
X is called a \textbf{binomial random variable} \index{binomial random variable} with parameters n and p. The following are all binomial random variables.

\subsubsection{Example 1} A Stat 1600 multiple choice quiz has five questions, with each question having five choices.  Let X be the number of correct answers (C) by someone who is guessing on all questions.  Then X is a binomial random variable with parameter values n = 5 and p = 0.2.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} ccccc @{}} \hline
Ques 1 & Ques 2 & Ques 3 & Ques 4 & Ques 5 \\
$.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ & $.2 \swarrow  \searrow .8$ \\
C \hspace{3mm} W & C  \hspace{3mm}  W &  C  \hspace{3mm}  W &   C \hspace{3mm} W & C \hspace{3mm}   W \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Example 2} Available data shows that 40\% of telephone respondents agree to be interviewed for market research surveys.  Suppose the polling organization Reliable Research randomly selects and dials telephone numbers until it reaches 50 respondents.  Let X be the number of respondents (out of the 50) who agree to be interviewed.  Then X is a binomial random variable with parameter values n = 50 and p = 0.40.

\subsubsection{Example 3} Historically, 20\% of buyers at Best Buy who purchase smart fitness and GPS watches (like Fitbit, Garmin, and Apple) also purchase the Geek Squadâ€™s protection plan.  Suppose Best Buy sold 300 smart fitness watches during the previous quarter.  Let X be the number of extended protection plans that the retailer sold along with the 300 smartwatches.  Then X is a Binomial random variable with parameter values n = 300 and p = 0.20.

\section{Computing Binomial Probabilities}

In Example 1, the number of correct guesses may be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.  How likely can a guesser get all five questions right? The answer is 0.0003, or about three times in 10000 attempts.  How about the likelihood of getting 2 out of 5 items right?  The answer is .2048, about a fifth of the time.  The following \textbf{probability distribution table} gives the likelihood or probability of each possible value of X.

<<label=LBL7a, results="asis", echo=FALSE>>=
  x1 <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5)
  size1 <- c(5,5,5,5,5,5)
  prob1 <- c(.2,.2,.2,.2,.2,.2)
  lst1  <- dbinom(x=x1, size=size1, prob=prob1)
@

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{} cccccc @{}} \hline
$P[X = 0]$ & $P[X = 1]$ & $P[X = 2]$ & $P[X = 3]$ & $P[X = 4]$ & $P[X = 5]$ \\ \hline
\Sexpr{lst1[1]} & \Sexpr{lst1[2]} & \Sexpr{lst1[3]} & \Sexpr{lst1[4]} & \Sexpr{lst1[5]} & \Sexpr{lst1[6]} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

You can compute these probabilities yourself by successively substituting \\ $j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \texttt{ and } 5$ in the formula

\begin{equation*}
 P[ X = j] = \frac{5!}{j! (5 - j)!} 0.2^j 0.8^{5 - j}, \texttt{ where j = 0,1,2,3,4,5 }
 \end{equation*}

Remember that $0! = 1$ and $(0.2)^0 = 1$.  This formula is called the \textbf{binomial probability distribution function (pdf)} for $n = 5$ and p$ = 0.2$.  To compute the probabilities for Examples 2 and 3, you will need the binomial pdf for general $n$ and $p$:

\begin{equation*}
 P[ X = j] = \frac{n!}{j! (n - j)!} p^j q^{n - j}, \texttt{ where j = 0,1,2, $\cdots$ , n}
 \end{equation*}


\subsubsection{Example 3} (Cont.):  The retailer sold ten smart fitness and GPS watches in one day.  What is the probability that customers purchased three extended Geek Squad protection plans?  Using the equation above with $n = 10, p = 0.20$, and $j = 3$, we get

\begin{equation*}
 P[ X = 3] = \frac{10!}{3! (10 - 3)!} .2^3 .8^{10 - 3} = 0.201
 \end{equation*}

\begin{minipage}[ht]{29mm}

\textbf{For practice}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{119mm}

Five percent of customers who rent video games from Gamers Retro Rental who return the rental late.  What is the probability that customers will return their rental late if 30 customers borrow a video game during the last hour?

\begin{enumerate}
\item 2 will be returned late
\item none will be returned late
\item 2 or fewer will be returned late
\item 5 or more will be returned late
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\section{Expected Value and SD of a Binomial Random Variable}

Suppose last quarter; Best Buy sold 300 Smart fitness watches.  If there is 0.20 likelihood of selling an extended protection plan with each smartwatch, the number of extended protection plans sold last quarter should be around 60 give or take 7 or so (we will compute this later).

We call the first number the expected value of the number of protection plans sold; the second number is the standard deviation.  Recall that X, the number of protection plans sold, is a \textbf{Binomial random variable}.  The \textbf{expected value}, denoted \textbf{E(X)}, of a binomial random variable X with parameters n and p is computed as:

\begin{equation*}
E[ X ] = np
\end{equation*}

The expected value $E(X)$ is also called the average or mean of X, and denoted $\mu$.  The standard deviation, denoted $SD(X)$ or $\sigma_x$, of a binomial random variable is computed as:

\begin{equation*}
SD(X) = \sigma_x = \sqrt{npq}
\end{equation*}

Returning to the example, since $n = 300$ and $p = 0.20$, we have $E(X) = 300(0.20) = 60$, and $SD(X) = \sqrt{300(0.20)(0.80)} = 6.93$, or approximately $60 \pm 7$.

The SD for random variables is interpreted similarly to the SD for a sample.  If the store sells 300 smartwatches sets every quarter, they won't sell precisely 60 Geek Squad protection plans every time; sometimes they will sell more, sometimes they will sell less.   By how much more, and how much less?  The answer is, ``By 7, on average.''   Similarly, a baseball player with 0.200 batting average won't necessarily get 60 hits in 300 at-bats.  We expect him to get 60 hits, give or take seven hits.

\begin{minipage}[ht]{29mm}

\textbf{For practice}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[ht]{119mm}

Suppose that 5\% of video games rented at Gamers Retro Rental incur a late rental fee. If 700 videos were rented last week, the number that will incur a late rental fee should be around \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxxxx}} give or take \underline{\phantom{xxxxxxxxxx}}.

\end{minipage}

\section{Computing Binomial Probabilities Using the Normal Curve}

Beyond the empirical rule, we may apply the normal curve to approximating binomial probabilities.  The key image is a plot of binomial probabilities as a histogram.  For example, Figure 7.1 is a histogram of binomial probabilities for $n = 30$ and $p = 0.4$.

The height of the rectangle over, say 10, is its probability $P[X = 10]$.  However, since the width of the rectangle is 1, then

\begin{equation*}
P[X = 10] = \texttt{ height of rectangle over 10 = area of rectangle over 10}
\end{equation*}

What about $P[X \le 10]$?  This probability corresponds to the total area of the rectangles over and the left of 10 (shaded rectangles in Figure 7.2)

The total area equals 0.2915 using the binomial probability function to compute the area (probability) of each shaded rectangle.  However, this requires repeated applications of the binomial formula (11 times, in fact).  We may calculate a quick approximation of the desired probability by replacing the rectangles with a curve!  See shaded area under the curve in Figure 7.2.

There are infinitely many normal curves, which one do we use to replace the rectangles?  Answer: the one with the same mean and SD as the rectangles!  The (binomial) rectangles have a \textbf{mean}:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu &=& np \\
  &=& (30)(.4) \\
  &=& 12
\end{eqnarray*}

The (binomial) rectangles have a SD:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma &=& \sqrt{npq} \\
  &=& \sqrt{(30)(.4)(.6)} \\
  &=& 2.68
\end{eqnarray*}

Using the normal curve with the same mean and SD, the area to the left of 10.5 is 0.2877, which is a close estimate of the actual area under the curve is 0.2915.

Similarly, $P[X = 14] = 0.1101$ is approximated by 0.1115, the area under the normal curve between 13.5 and 14.5.

\section{Some Approximations Are Better Than Others}

Examine the shape of the binomial histogram for n = 20 and p = 0.10 in Figure 7.3.

Since the curve is right-skewed, we will get a poor approximation of areas if we replace the rectangles by a normal curve.  If the value of p were 0.90 instead of 0.10, the binomial histogram would be left-skewed.  It is typical behavior of binomial histograms whenever $p$ is either too close to 0 or too close to 1.  When is it `safe' to use the normal curve to approximate binomial probabilities?  A convenient rule of thumb is as follows:

\fbox{\parbox{14cm}{
The \textbf{Normal Curve gives reasonable approximations} of binomial probabilites whenever both $np > 5$ and $nq >5$.
}}

We remind the reader that the normal curve approximations are still approximations.  The binomial formula should be used to calculate exact probabilities whenever possible.
