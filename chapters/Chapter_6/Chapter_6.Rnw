\begin{itemize}
\item Define and explain the concept of the {\textbf{Normal Curve}}.
\item Convert empirical scores to z-scores and use z-scores and the Normal Distribution curve table to find areas above, below and between points of the curve and express them regarding their probabilities.

\section{Using the normal curve} \index{Normal Curve}

Best Buy wants to know how many smart fitness and GPS watches (like Fitbit, Garmin, and Apple) to order for their Kalamazoo location. Past data show that this time of year, they sell an average of 36 fitness watches per month, with a standard deviation of 8.

\subsubsection{Problem 6.2.1}  If they order 40 watches, what is the probability that they will run out of stock?

\subsubsection{Problem 6.2.2}  \label{LBL622} Given the cost of running out of stock and the storage cost of keeping too many, the manager decides to order enough smartwatches to cover customer demands 90\% of the time, i.e., there should be 10\% or less likelihood that they run out of stock. How many should they order?

Knowing the average and SD of a process $(36 \pm 8)$ gives us some understanding of what to expect.  However, the sales situation above requires the computation of probabilities, or chances, as in the ``chance of demand exceeding 40.''   This desired probability is the shaded area to the right of 40 under the histogram of demand (see the first graph in Figure 6.1).  Does this look like 0.20 of the total area?  0.30?  0.40?

\begin{figure}[ht]

ggarrange(hist1, density1, ncol = 2, nrow = 1)

# annotate(geom = "text",
#  dt1 <- rnorm(n=1000, mean=36, sd=8),
#  hist(dt1, freq = FALSE, main="Probability of Demand > 40", xlab="X"),

#  yv <- dnorm(xv, mean=36, sd=8),

#  polygon(c(xv[xv>40], 40), c(dnorm(c(xv[xv>40], 1e-4), mean=36,sd=8)),col="skyblue" )
@
\end{figure}

The normal curve (or bell curve) is useful in helping us calculate probabilities like these.  If we smooth out the histogram in Figure 6.1, it will look like a normal curve.  More precisely, it will look like a normal curve with a mean of 36 and an SD of 8, denoted as $N(36, 8)$.  So the shaded area on the left will be approximated by the shaded area under the $N(36, 8)$ curve on the right.  Do the two shaded regions look the same?

Of course, the areas look similar because, in our example, the histogram on the left looks like a normal curve.  It does not have to.  If it does not, then the approximation of areas using the normal curve will be wrong.  We should use the normal curve approximation with caution.

\subsubsection{The Standard Normal or Z Curve}

The standard normal curve (or Z-curve) looks like Figure 6.2, and has the following properties:

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{10cm}{
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item center is at zero
  \item The area under the curve satisfies the following: \\
  The area between -1 and +1 is 0.68 \\
  The area between -2 and +2 is 0.95 \\
  The area between -3 and +3 is 0.997 \\
  The area between $- \infty$ and $+ \infty$ is 1.00
  \end{enumerate}
}}
\end{center}

  x_coor  <- seq(from=-4, to=4, by=1)
  z_labs  <- x_coor
  yrng  <- diff(range(yv))
  df1<-data.frame(xv,yv)

In general, area under the curve for \textit{positive Z values} can be found using the Z-table on \ref{TBL61} on page 82 at the end of this chapter.

Are we ready to find the area under the normal curve in Figure 6.1?  Not yet.  The horizontal axis in Figure 6.1 is wrong for the Z-table, it does not have a mean of 0 (horizontal axis) and an SD of 1. Instead, it has a mean of 36 and an SD of 8.  The trick is to replace the $N(36, 8)$ horizontal axis with a $N(0, 1)$ axis, labeled Z.  See Figure 6.3.  Note that $Z = 1$ whenever X is one SD above the mean.  Similarly, $Z = -1$ whenever $X$ is one SD below the mean.  In general, Z is related to $X$ as follows:

  \begin{equation} Z = \text{number of SD away from the mean} = \frac{X - mean}{SD} \end{equation}

What is the probability of demand exceeding 40?  This is the area under the curve to the right of $X = 40$ or $Z = 0.5$ (see Figure 6.4).  Using the $Z$-table, this area is $1 -  0.6915 = 0.3085$.

\section{Calculating percentiles}     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We restate Problem 6.2.2 on page \pageref{LBL622} given at the start of the chapter.

\textbf{Problem 6.2.2}  Given the cost of running out of stock and the value of having too many, the manager decides to order enough smartwatches to cover customer demands 90\% of the time, i.e., there should be 10\% or less chance that they run out of stock.  How many should they order?

We want to estimate the number of smartwatches so that there is only a 10\% chance of running out.  Note that this is the 90th percentile of demand.

Looking at Figure 6.5, we see that we need to shade the upper 10\% of the area under the curve  .  What X value corresponds to the boundary?  When we use the normal table, the Z-value 90th percentile is 1.28.  What X value corresponds to Z = 1.28?  We solve equation 6.1 backward.

\begin{eqnarray*}
1.28 & = & \frac{X - 36}{8}  \\
36 + 1.28(8) & = & X-36 + 36  \\
36 + 1.28(8) & = & X  \\
X & = & 46.24 
\end{eqnarray*}

\newpage

The manager should have at least 47 smartwatches in the store.

\section{Calculating symmetric tail areas}

In later sections, we will need to calculate tail areas (or $P$-values).  For example, how frequently does a normal variable fall outside of 2.25 SD from the center?  We know a random variable following a normal distribution falls within 1 SD from the center 68\% of the time, and hence outside of 1 SD from the center only 32\% of the time.  What about 2.25 SD?

The area outside of 2.25 SD from the center is the combined area left of -2.25 and right of 2.25.  From the $Z$-table, the area to the right of 2.25 is 1 - 0.9878 = 0.0122.  Therefore, the combined tail areas is 0.0122 + 0.0122 = 0.0244.  A random variable following a normal distribution falls outside of 2.25 SD from the center only 2\% of the time.

Fast-food restaurants \\ spend a lot of time researching the time spent servicing their customers who use the drive-through window.

Let's assume that the drive-through time are \\ normally distributed.
