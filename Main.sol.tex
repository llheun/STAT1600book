1.  What might be wrong about these headlines?
  a.	A study proclaims: ``Slightly overweight people live longer than thin people.'' ``Slightly overweight people live longer than thin people.''  It is a fallacy of correlation equals causation.  It statement implies that being slightly overweight causes people to live longer when compared to thin people.  We would want to dig deeper into the study to see what confounding variables may be present: did we take into account health of the individuals?  Perhaps we have some individuals in poor health leading them to be thin and shortening their lives.

Randomized controlled experiments are necessary to establish the cause of such a disease firmly. For instance, we might see if potassium deficiency causes the disease, we may give our treatment group a potassium supplement every day. However, if the illness is rare, then it is impractical for us to use a randomized controlled experiment.  It would also be unethical to be influencing or causing disease in people potentially.  Additionally, we would have no guarantee that any subjects would even develop the disease if it is sporadic. Thus, observational studies may be the most appropriate choice unless scientific advances in, say, genetics are far enough along to make a more practical kind of randomized controlled experiment.

\end{exsol@solution}
\begin{exsol@solution}{5.5-4}
A randomized controlled experiment is the ``gold standard of scientific knowledge'' so that it would be the best way to study this situation. We would study four groups of patients: group one would get a standard treatment for an illness, group two would get a placebo without being told it's a placebo, group 3 would get a placebo and told it's a placebo, and group 4 would get no treatment at all. This method would, interestingly, give controls both from the standard and no-treatment groups. The groups for primary comparisons would be the two groups that get the placebos and are either informed or not.

Yes, there are potential confounders. For instance, it might be that players feel better rested at the start of a game, so they play harder and get injured more frequently because of this possibility. The organization could investigate the frequency of injuries that occur during later kickoffs in the game or to conduct small-scale randomized controlled experiments that change kickoff rules before recommending substantial sweeping changes.
